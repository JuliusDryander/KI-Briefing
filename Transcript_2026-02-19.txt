(01:31:33) - Blake Dodge, a journalist at Pirate Wires, transitioned from investigative reporting at Business Insider to focus on optimistic tech narratives. She discusses California's proposed wealth tax, highlighting billionaire departures due to concerns over the tax's retroactive nature and its impact on business. Dodge also emphasizes the importance of tech leaders engaging in visible public works to foster goodwill amid growing inequality.

(01:46:50) - Fredrik deBoer, a writer and former academic, now authors a Substack newsletter and writes books, enjoying the independence of self-publishing. He discusses his skepticism toward exaggerated claims about AI's imminent impact on the economy, highlighting the inconsistency between dire predictions and the reluctance of AI proponents to commit to specific, measurable outcomes. To challenge these assertions, deBoer proposed a wager with blogger Scott Alexander, betting that in three years, economic indicators would remain within normal ranges, thereby questioning the narrative of an impending AI-driven economic upheaval.

Prasad explains the fund's structure, investment strategy, and recent investments, including a $100 million secondary purchase in Anthropic.

In the conversation, he discusses Mesh Optical's first product—a pluggable transceiver designed to enhance GPU cluster connectivity within data centers by eliminating power-hungry components, thereby improving efficiency. He also highlights the company's commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, aiming to scale production to millions of units by 2027 to meet the growing demand for optical interconnects in AI data centers.

(02:28:18) - Evan Spiegel, co-founder and CEO of Snap Inc., discusses the implementation of safeguards in generative video features to prevent misuse, the expansion of Snapchat's developer ecosystem with over 400,000 developers creating lenses, and the potential of tools like Easy Lens to democratize lens creation through prompts.
