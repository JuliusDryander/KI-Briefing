 - Sigil Wen discusses his concept of Web 4.0, envisioning an Internet where AI acts as the end user, capable of autonomously performing tasks and making payments without human intervention. He introduces the "automaton," a self-sufficient AI model that can self-edit its code, manage its own compute resources, and generate income to sustain its operations. Wen emphasizes the importance of building this new Internet openly to ensure safety and transparency as AI becomes increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems.

 - Saagar Enjeti is an American journalist and political commentator, best known as the co-host of the independent news program "Breaking Points" alongside Krystal Ball. In the conversation, Enjeti discusses the impact of social media and technology on children, emphasizing the addictive nature of devices like iPads and the challenges parents face in regulating screen time. He highlights the importance of setting boundaries and the potential benefits of government regulation to mitigate the negative effects of technology on youth.

 - Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, a web-based vector graphics editing software company, discusses the company's impressive 2025 performance, highlighting a 40% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.046 billion and the successful launch of four new products, including Figma Make, an AI-powered prototyping tool. He emphasizes the importance of design in product development and the role of AI in enhancing creativity, noting that 60% of Figma Make users are non-designers, reflecting the platform's accessibility and broad appeal. Field also shares insights on the evolving design landscape, expressing excitement about increased innovation and diversity in digital product aesthetics and user experiences.

 - Peter Morales, CEO of Code Metal, discusses his journey from defense and AI research to founding the company, highlighting his work on AI algorithms for the F-35 fighter jet and at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. He explains Code Metal's mission to automate the translation of high-level code into hardware-optimized, production-ready code, addressing challenges in deploying AI on edge devices. Morales also announces a $125 million Series B funding round and the appointment of Ryan, former CEO of Tableau, as President and COO to support the company's growth.

 - Erik Palitsch, CEO and Co-Founder of Freeform, discusses the company's development of Skyfall, an advanced laser melting platform, and their recent $67 million Series B funding led by Linz Capital, with participation from NVIDIA, Founders Fund, Threshold, and Two Sigma Ventures. He highlights the growing demand across various sectors, emphasizing the importance of flexible manufacturing in today's geopolitical climate and the acceleration of product design driven by AI advancements. Palitsch also notes that Freeform is currently producing mission-critical parts for multiple frontier programs and plans to expand their team significantly over the next year.

 - Ljubisa Bajic, a seasoned chip designer and CEO of Taalas, discusses his company's innovative approach to AI hardware by embedding AI models directly into silicon, resulting in ultra-fast, cost-effective responses. This method sacrifices flexibility for performance, enabling immediate, large-scale outputs at minimal cost. Bajic also highlights the simplicity and efficiency of their chips, which integrate seamlessly into standard servers without the need for complex cooling systems or high-speed I/O, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible and affordable.

You're watching TBPN!

Today is Thursday, February 19, 2026.

We are live from the TVVN Ultrum,

the Temple of Technology, the Fortures of Finance,

the Capital of Capital.

Let me tell you about RAMP.com.

Time is money.

Save both.



Easy use corporate cards, bill pay,

accounting a whole lot more all in one place.

We had to practice that.

Handshake tutorial.

In case you were wondering how to shake hands with your friend

or with your enemy, it works.

It's the same.

It's the same process.



You grab the hand with great force.

Yes.

and

underrated

while you can establish

dominance.

You can handshake mock clearly.

Huge missed opportunity



for Sam and Dario

not to...

To crush each other's hands

to the point where the other one

is bleeding and crying.

That would have really set the tone.

They have to rely on voice transcript

exactly, exactly.



It would have been much better

to just watch

crushing in the hand.

You know,

you do those like strength training

for a reason.

That's right.

Every once in a while



you don't want to get caught lacking.

Anyway,

there's big news today.

We're canceling the SaaSpocalypse.

It's over.

RIP SaaSpocalypse.

It occurred from January, 2026 to February, 2026, and it's over now.

We're declaring it over.



No, it's not entirely over.

Who knows where the market will go.

In many ways, it's just getting started.

In many ways, it's just getting started.

But I do think we're starting to see a bifurcation in the slopable companies and the unslappable companies.

There should be some divergence between companies that have figured out how to integrate with AI,

how to retool their business model, or just show that they're just show that.

their business model was strong all along.



And we'll go through that.

Well, yeah, there's a category of SaaS.

Yes.

That is SaaS.

Yes.

But they will be fine.

AI beneficiaries.

Yep.



Totally.

Totally.

Should we,

should we watch?

Have you seen Pacific Rim?

No.

We got to watch this pump up speech.

Let's do it.



Because this gets me fired up.

We're canceling the apocalypse.

It's movie night again in class.

This is from Pacific Rim.

We're going to a minute 22 in here.

Jump ahead because this is one of the greatest speeches.

You don't want to watch.

You don't want to.



We can watch the full two.

It's raining.

It's raining.

It's raining.

We'll watch the full thing.

We'll watch the full thing.

It's my favorite movie.

This is honestly my favorite movie.



I might watch an Apple Vision Pro this weekend.

Who knows?

It's such a great film.

And did you know?

The director of this film won an Academy Award.

That's right.

This is an Academy Award winning director at work.

Here's the director.



Guillermo del Toro.

He won for Shape of Water.

He did not win for Pacific Rim, but he should have

because this film is fantastic.

So, the storyline.

Aliens, giant alien Godzilla-like creatures called Kaiju's have descended upon Earth.

No.

And only robots that are as big as the Godzilla's can fight back.



But you need two people.

It's much like us.

You need two pilots because the mental load of driving the robot, being in the drift,

is too intense for a single person.

It will drive you crazy.

So two pilots, two Jaeger pilots must pilot the ship together and share the load.

And so they both punch and then the robot punches.

It's amazing.



It's a great film.

You'll love it.

He's got to give a speech.

You're known for giving great speeches just like this.

This is a Jordy Hayes original right here.

Yes, movie day.

Again, welcome to the stream, Ryan.

Today.



At the edge of our hope.

Things aren't looking at this point.

The end of our time.

The end of our time.

AI is upon us.

We are chosen not only to believe in ourselves.

but in each other.

We must believe in the stocks of the SaaS companies.



There is not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone.

No, no public company shareholder will stand alone.

We stand with you.

Today we face the monsters that are at our door and bring the fight to them.

We're bringing the fight to the Foundation Labs.

Today we are canceling the apocalypse.

We're canceling the apocalypse.

We're canceling the SaaS apocalypse.



Woo!

And then the greatest soundtrue.

track.

I love it.

I only really had to ever give one speech like that last year.

But it hit.

It hit.

The team needed it.



We did.

We got through.

Critical moment.

We powered through.

We powered through.

So anyway, we've lost a lot of good soldiers, a lot of good market cap out there during

the Saspocalypse, two trillion dollars, something like that, maybe.

It's been rough.



But, and, and, I mean, truthfully, like the narrative does make sense.

like agentic AI systems, co-pilots, foundation models,

like these are disruptive innovations.

Fundamentally, they're counter positioned

against traditional seat-based SaaS pricing.

We know this.

Legacy companies will be caught in a jam

because pivoting the entire business model is difficult.



You can't just flip a switch

and start charging customers in a completely different way.

Your investors will freak out

because your finances will be deeply unprofitable

all of a sudden in the public markets.

Or just very different.

It'll take time to build back up.

And also, like, company cultures



and organizational structures are aligned around

particular incentives.

And so you have to rewire everything

for a different business model.

And that's really hard.

And that's why people are sounding the,

this is a disruptive innovation.

This is not a sustaining innovation



like mobile or cloud.

The AI version of, you know,

X, Y, Z, SaaS company

will not be like the mobile version

of that SaaS company.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And even the safer bets,



like the system of record,

there's this concern.

earn around, okay, well, can an agent just kind of re-platform you?

Like, does that, if you can onboard to a new system faster, does that decrease the lock-in?

But continue.

So the SaaSpocalypse was always a little bit of an indiscriminate hammer.

It felt like, I mean, there was one article in the journal that was like Anthropic launched

a legal tool and that caused the sell off.



And it's like, well, it could be that or it also could be Claude Code or it could be OpenClawe or

codex or Spark or like there's a million different things going on in the AI world. That one just

kind of took hold. But it became this like indiscriminate hammer that just kind of hit every

company and during earning season, every CEO had to talk about AI and the threat of AI. But I think

we will soon be finding out what companies are truly unslappable as you put it and actually benefit

in the AI future. And there's a bunch of early signals. So let's run through them. First, Google's

come back. I mean, this was the first victim of the

apocalypse. This one happened like a year or two ago.



Why would anyone

search Google ever if an

LLM could get you a better answer and fewer clicks?

Of course, Google quickly caught up to the frontier.

They launched AI overviews. They flex deep

deep minds research previews.

They showed off the power of the TPU.

Core business is surviving and thriving.



Do in part to Gemini, helping

understand intent so they can deliver ads

on longer, more complex searches.

So Google's been doing fine. They're

sort of already building back from the

SaaSpocalypse they experienced. Then you have meta, will user minutes migrate over to LLMs,

will SORA destroy Instagram overnight, we'll slop-clog the feeds, maybe, but not before

Meta's transformer-based gem model absolutely destroys ad targeting and just makes everything so



much better and re-accelerates revenue. And we've talked to a lot of folks about that. And so meta's

doing very well, even though they haven't like figured out their AI strategy rolled out any of the new

crazy frontier models from MSL, like the business is great because they're, because they're,

yeah, I think they have the, you can certainly argue they have an AI strategy.

Totally.

Use AI ML to make really good ads.

They've been doing it for a decade.

But it's more on the product side, right?



So is it the manis?

Is it net new product?

Yeah.

Is it meta-AI?

Yep.

And so there's, it gets more interesting when you go to the smaller companies, not super small,

but Spotify.

Spotify doesn't really need to invest in.



generative AI. I heard a good analogy that was like, did, did, should, should Spotify have, like,

released a guitar so that people can make more music? Like, no, because people will pick whatever

tools available and then they will release that music on Spotify and then the algorithm will

sort it. And so the, like, you know, these artists, if they're using AI tools, or maybe

they're just prompters, whatever you want to call them, they will bring AI music to the platform.

It'll be filtered by algorithms. Slop will be in the trough.

But only the most delicious slop will bubble to the top of the trough.

So it's good to be in the trough business,



as long as you have an algorithm that sorts the trough, the slop,

from the more sloppy slop, I don't know.

Well said.

Current data shows AI music currently underperforms dramatically on a percentage basis.

Like the number of AI songs is huge,

but the number of actual minutes watched and is low.

Even if that flips, Spotify still benefits.

Let's switch over to Shopify.



You can definitely vibe code an e-commerce website now, but Shopify is not a major cost driver for most businesses that use it.

You're talking maybe like $1,000 a month for some companies, and it's a lot of headache that they just don't have to even think about.

And then there's a whole bunch of advantages that Shopify should benefit from in the AI era.

It's very full-featured, so it's actually hard to replace.

Setting up a new store is faster than waiting for a prompt to return.

like it's all pre-built, and it's just like create a new copy in the database of Shopify when you set up a new store.

And then AI tools benefit from all the context and data that Shopify has across the entire platform.

And then lastly, Agentic Commerce doesn't replace Shopify checkout.



It's just a front end to the checkout, much more like mobile or social.

Exactly.

Post-purchase.

So if it's driving activity, that's actually a net benefit.

And so there's a whole bunch more examples.

Roblox is another interesting example.

I heard a crazy stat.

67% of global non-China spending growth



in the gaming industry last year went to Roblox.

Like, gaming had a bad year.

Roblox had a fantastic year.

And I think the stock's down like 50%.

And so, you know, yes, you can vibe code a video game,

but the Roblox network and ecosystem is already at scale,

and it's absolutely dominating,

and they're monetizing a ton.



And their monetization on a per minute basis

is I think like five times lower than other platforms.

like if you comp it to TikTok or Instagram.

And so whether it's ads or more in-game currencies or something like the willingness to pay should go up.

Now there's still a question about, you know, do folks age out of Roblox?

How long can they keep these customers on?

Will they get older folks to rejoin Roblox at some point or join Roblox for the first time at some point?

But certainly, you know, not probably a beneficiary of AI vibe coding and being able to build more stuff.



And again, filtering the different apps that are built so that grow a garden or,

steal a brain rot can be power law outcomes within that ecosystem, that's the value of filtering

and being an aggregator.

Lastly, you've got to consider Salesforce.

Mark Benioff has been duking it out with Jim Kramer on CNBC over CPEB's pricing in an AI

era for over a year now, and it's 100% true that there are some amazing AI Native CRM startups

that are aggressively trying to eat off Benioff's plate.

But Anthropic is hiring a Salesforce admin.



We put up a card for this because we really enjoyed this.

But where was it?

Do we put this?

Yes.

Unemployed vibe coder.

Bro, SaaS is dead.

You can build a CRM in minutes.

No modern company is going to buy software ever again.



Repost.

And I'll send you my PDF that killed Salesforce.

And then Anthropic has a job listing for Salesforce admin because they're growing so fast and so big that they need someone just to be full-time job, manage their internal Salesforce.

The project.

That's so big.

I iconic opportunity.

Is this revealed preference?

Is there something else going on here?



Are they, is this person going to be reinforcement learning data for them?

Who knows?

But at least for right now, they're going to be paying Salesforce.

And time will tell.

And then lastly, you know, the SaaSpocalypse, it might arrive in full at some point,

and we'll start to see real revenue declines, which I think would be like the real signal

of major disruption.

But Figma just announced 70% growth in weekly active users, 40% year-over-year revenue growth.



We have Dillon Field coming on the show in just a little bit.

He'll be on at 1.30 today.

And so there's growth all over the SaaS ecosystem,

and things don't seem to be decelerating or slowing down.

It's definitely go time, though, and it's time to revisit sources of strength.

It's wartime.

It's time to become unslappable.

It is wartime.



It's founder mode time.

And at least you need to explain why you were never slopable in the first place.

And that's what Harley at Shopify did a really good job of on the earnings call.

he got so many questions he had to back up and just re-explain you know people got in the weeds on the

AI checkout thing and he had to re-explain like no like agentic checkout happens on top of the on top of

the shopify checkout the economics are exactly the same they're exactly the same so like don't worry

basically yeah so going back to the fax machine example in 1999 was the first year that showed a significant drop

in the sale of physical fax machines.



They dropped by 10% in a single year.

When was that?

In 1999.

1999, yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

And so that's a, that is not a, okay, growth just started slowing.

Yeah.



It had been slowing up until that point, but it was slowing and then it like fell off a cliff.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That makes sense.

Quickly, let me tell you about Vanta, automate compliance and security.

Vanta is the leading AI trust management platform.

And let's also pull up the linear lineup.

and tell you who's coming on on the show. Linear, of course, is the system for modern software



development. 70% of enterprise workspaces on linear are using agents. We have Cigil.

We have Cigil coming on to talk about a new Web 4.0, a new AI agent project that he's working

on where AI can deploy, transact, and pay its own bills, run micro economies without humans in the

loop. Then, of course, we have Sager and Jetty from breaking points coming on. Always a fun

conversation. And then Dylan Field coming on to talk about their earnings and everything that

they're doing with Claude, Chat Chatsubut, Gemini, and all of those folks. And then we have Peter

from Code Metal announcing his Series B. Eric from Freeform, another Series B. And then Lubisa from

Tallis, announcing $169 million raise building model-specific AI chips. So Bangor lineup today.



And can't wait to get to those folks.

Should we read through this Goodwill hunting meme?

This sums up the SaaSpocalypse pretty well.

And I love this meme template from malinvestment.jpg.

Of course, that's your contention.

You're a first time SaaS bear.

You just got finished listening to some podcasts,

Dario on Dwar Keshe probably.



Now you think it's the end of white color work

and seat-based pricing is screwed.

You're going to be convinced of that till tomorrow

when you get to something big is happening.

then you'll install Claudebot on a Mac Mini vibe-coded dashboard on top of a Postgres database

and say we're all just a couple Ralph loops away from building a Salesforce competitor.

That's going to last until next week when you discover context graphs.

And then you're going to be talking about how the systems of record will be disintermediated by an agentic layer



and reposting OAI marketing graphics.

Well, as a matter of fact, I won't because ultimately the application layer is just,

the application layer is just business logic on top of a cred database.

You got that from Sot's appearance on the BG2 pod.

December 2024, right?

Yeah, I saw that too.

Were you going to plagiarize the whole thing for us?

Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter?



Or is that your thing?

You get into the replies of anyone posting a SaaS sticker.

You watch some podcasts, then pawned off as your own idea to impress some VCs and embarrass

some Anans who's long sass.

See, the sad thing about a guy like you is in a couple of years, you're going to start

doing some thinking on your own and you're going to come up with the fact that there are

two certainties in life.

One, don't do that.



And two, you drop 30 grand on Mac minis and LLM API calls to come up with the same conclusions

you could have got for free by following a handful of EC accounts.

It's great.

Roasted.

I love that meme.

That's fantastic.

Anyway, there's another post in here to close out the SaaSpocalypse.

Buck says there's a long history of dominant platforms vertically integrating and consuming



the entire economy.

That is why the largest companies in the world today are railroads, utilities, steam engine

manufacturers and CPU producers.

Love it.

Great.

Very good.

Let me tell you about TurboPuffer, serverless vector in full-text search, build from first principles

on object storage, fast, 10x cheaper, and extremely scalable.



Bland hit the timeline yesterday.

They unveiled Soldier AI, the first rapper to automate their voice with AI.

Let's watch this video.

Soldier Boy or use his voice yourself.

I want to see...

With sound of course.

I want to see what Soldier Boy...

I was the first rap on YouTube.



The first rap with his own star.

The first rapper with the iPhone, and now I'm the first rapper to automate his voice with AI.

Blan, baby.

People, I thought this was a fun concept.

Yeah.

But many people did not.

It didn't really resonate.

It definitely got attention.



I bet they drove a bunch of business from this.

One million views, six new likes.

Yeah.

Usually on a million views, you want to be sitting somewhere around 30,000.

Couple thousand.

No, a couple thousand likes.

I mean, it's something that people love and genuinely resonates will get upwards of 20,000 or more.

Yeah.



Anyways, I think it's cool.

I'm surprised we haven't seen more of this kind of thing, celebrities coming in.

I think Solja obviously is not at the peak of his career, so it makes sense for him to dip his toes in here.

And I bet this was surprisingly affordable for Bland.

So hopefully they got some business out of it.

So yeah, it's interesting.

11 Labs has Michael Cain, Bert Reynolds, Richard Feynman, Sir Lawrence Olivier,

Dr. Maya Angelou, James Dean, Judy Garland, Albert Einstein.



Then there's some AI voices you can just do like Will, Jessica, Eric, Bella,

and there's community voices as well.

I wonder if they should do more promotion around my...

Michael Cain. Like, that's clearly a licensing deal, but I haven't, like, the reason this

breaks through is because there's a video of Soldier Boy, it's a real video, and it's funny,

and he's like, go on camera, right? The entire premise is you can have Soldier Boy answer your

business phone calls, which is like pretty, which is pretty differentiated, which is extremely

differentiated. And if you're, let's say you're, you're a kind of business, let's say you have a



smoothie shop. Yeah. Like, adding this, we'll certainly get people talking about it. Probably delightful.

I called the Azaibo place and Soldier Boy picked up.

Yeah.

Like, this will, this will, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm not going to pile on.

I think it's fun.

Yeah.

I think that also just as a top of funnel activation, like you hear about this, you go and

you're like, okay, realistically, my business doesn't need Soldier Boy, but my business does



need like just a normal voice.

I kind of missed opportunity to say, like, I'm the first AI.

rapper with no W. No W.

Yeah, play on words. Which they didn't do in what I'm seeing.

Well, if you want intelligent real-time conversational agents, head over to 11 labs.

Reimagined Human Technology Interaction with 11 labs.

Ice T, according to Justine Moore, is an AI accelerationist.

This is great.



He is hitting the timeline.

Somebody said, I wish more older rappers realize that AI shouldn't touch the music industry

in the way that impacts the creative work, including music videos.

say AI, some people group in stem separation or restoration into that, and that's not what I'm

talking about. Anyways, so basically stem separation is when you have a full song and you want to

separate like the guitar from the drums from the bass, like the stems. Got it, got it, got it,

because you're a guitarist, right? Isn't that the word? Guitar player? But I C says, I disagree. Fans

want us to make and produce music, then shoot an expensive video, then they get it for free if they



have an Apple subscription or Spotify pay us.

0.07 census street.

The days of expensive videos are over.

There isn't even MTV.

AI is the only sensible way to add visuals to a song.

You can hate it all you want.

It's the future.

It's the future.



Is Ice Tea still going to, is he dropping music videos recently?

Like has he actually, is he just predicting this or is he living this and actually putting

out AI videos?

It certainly does make sense to just bring down the cost of music video production.

I mean, that's what a lot of CGI did.

A lot of music videos are just the artist on a green screen with cool graphics in the background.

And that's often enough.

I mean, there used to be the age of the expensive music video.



Wasn't it?

Thriller?

Was like multiple millions of dollars?

And you cannot spend that much anymore.

No way.

And so a lot of music videos have come down and cost, done more in CGI.

It feels like AI will get there, but you have to be the right artist and you have to message it correctly because there's going to be crazy backlash.

Matthew McConaughey hit Variety this morning.



What you say?

And commenting on AI, Brandon just shared it.

He said, it's coming.

It's already here.

Don't deny it.

It's not going to be enough to sit on the sidelines and make the moral plea that, no, this is wrong.

It's not going to last.

There's too much money to be made and it's too productive.



AIA acceleration.

So I say, own yourself, voice likeness, et cetera, trade market, whatever you got to do.

So when it comes, no one can steal you.

Yeah.

Yeah, it makes sense.

The Matthew McConae voice, I mean, that's an iconic voice.

I think there's definitely a huge deal to be done.

And the AI voices, although we're in a boom right now, I remember being able to go on ways and pick.



I think Snoop Dog had a deal, but there were a number of celebrities that had,

You can imagine like an Arnold Schwarzenegger, get to the chopper, but then also like take a left and it's like fun and they would just pre-record all of the different lines like keep going straight

Bear left take a hard left and you record like 20 different lines and then the program just picks the audio file for the correct moment because there's only like 20 different things you could possibly say in a navigation app and so a whole bunch of celebrities did deals at least temporarily. I don't know how many of them are still around but those types of

of things, like, there's clearly a framework for that and all the agencies and all the unions

understand this. So I feel like we're in this weird, like, bizarre world where people think

that, like, oh, like, IP does law doesn't exist and we aren't going to be able to deal with this.

It's like, no, like, there's like decades of lawyers who, like, are foaming at the mouth being like,

I can't wait to sue bite dance. This is going to be awesome. We're going to get a great settlement.



is that it's going to require real cooperation from platforms.

The platforms are ready to cooperate.

I disagree.

I don't think they're cooperating that hard.

There's so much, there's so much content of a bunch of individuals on YouTube, on

meta, that is using their name and likeness and putting them in situations that they would

never, ever, ever agree to.

And you can argue that it's not good for their brand, but it's incredibly entertaining.



and so the platforms leave the content up.

And yes, you can do take-down requests and things like that.

But by the time you do a takedown request, it's got 200,000 likes.

You don't need to do a take-down request.

You just need to do pay, pay me, pay me.

That's what people want.

They want to be paid.

I think the message in that Matthew McConaughey post is not,



is not like, it's super critical that no one ever uses an image of me or my voice ever.

It's that, look, if somebody's profiting off of it,

That's my IP.

I mean, I read his comment more around making movies,

saying don't use AI to make this scene that would normally take four weeks

in some exotic location and a thousand people.

Obviously, AI is going to be used for that.

I think there's a separate issue of people generating Matthew McConaughey doing and saying



things that he would never agree to that are sort of compromising or, again,

putting him in situations or having him say things that he wouldn't ever agree to, even if he was

getting paid. Yeah, I just think, like, the answer is, like, more AI. Like, you look at the SORA,

like, the SORA cameo functionality. And, like, it was, it was pretty easy for me to say, like,

always depict me as a bodybuilder. And as silly as that is, like, it worked. Like, like, when we did

that collab post with the Open AI team, they were like, we don't know how to get around this.

And we're like, you should be able to go in and change this, but they didn't because, like, it is actually enforced at, like, a pretty low level.

Alex, from Outtake, who we've had on the show, he does this for a bunch of outtake does this for a bunch of different celebrities where you basically sign up for Outtake.



And they're constantly monitoring the entire internet and filing takedown requests on your behalf.

And so I think, again, I think it'll end up, I think the platforms will do something, but it will also be somewhat of a,

attacks. Let me tell you about cognition. They're the makers of Devon, the AI Software Engineer.

Crush your backlog with your personal AI engineering team. Let's actually watch the full video

of the AI Impact Summit in India. Narendra Modi is there. Insane lineup. Insane lineup. They pulled

everyone. They got Sundar there. They got Alex Wang there. They got Dario. They got Sam.

And here we go. And they're zooming out. And what do we see? Two fists.

raised in opposition iconic.



Throwing up the X.

Throwing up the X.

Someone on X was saying that...

Haters would say this is AI.

Yeah, that it was a little shout out to Elon saying,

you're not here, but you're here with us.

And if you scroll down someone, you used AI to show them hugging,

which is very nice.



Yeah, like we said, missed opportunity for one of them to...

For a handshake mug?

to do, yeah, a handshake mug.

No doubt.

They'll be back next year.

Yes.

I think this is an annual thing.

Yeah, and it seems like a banger lineup.



I wonder if there'll be talks that will come out of this,

any more comments or just, was it off the record,

or will there just be reporting out of this?

Or maybe it was just talking points.

There was no real, like, news dropped.

But if you get those folks together,

it should feel like Davos.

There should be interesting sort of new positions that are coming out.



Yeah, the Mr. All founder would apparently speak,

speaking there and the room was like almost empty.

We really?

And so, uh, and yeah, somebody was saying like, hey, this guy is actually like crushing it

in Europe like show him some respect, put some respect. Sit down, take notes.

Study. Yeah, sit down and study it. Don't just listen. Don't just listen. Let me tell you about

label box. Reinforcement learning environments, voice robotics, evals and expert human data. Label box is

the data factory behind the world's leading AI teams. J.C. Foster. Yes.



says three months ago, I quit my job to chase a dream to build an affordable,

convenient, plastic-free coffee maker.

Grateful for everyone who has reserved companies called Pure Steel.

This is a correct ratio.

Seven million views, 34,000 likes.

This is what you were getting at.

Huge.

What is up with the laptop?



So I guess he was at SpaceX.

Very long.

He was at SpaceX.

And one of the, when I immediately saw it, I mean, can we talk about this laptop?

Look at what is going on.

Zoom in on this laptop.

I think this is he took it.

It's like an optical illusion.



Okay.

Right?

It's using the fish eye lens.

Oh.

Okay.

Because if you fold, if based on this angle, if you folded the screen.

Yeah, the screen would just cover the keyboard.

Like the track pad would just be hanging out.



Like an untucked t-shirt under a sweater.

Makes no sense.

Sorry, Jordi.

I got distracted by the extremely long,

long laptop. Tell me more about the pure steel company of America. The pure steel company of

America. So yeah, so anyway, started going viral. Very, very cool product. If you've tried to make

coffee without having plastic be a part of the process, it's incredibly hard and you're pouring

hot liquid over plastic. Sure. Some of that plastic will disintegrate. Yep. End up in your cup of



Joe. So the product makes a lot of sense. One of the issues is this post went extremely

viral.

And somebody said,

somebody posted,

this thing's only 80 bucks.

Go reserve this right now.

And so that post started going really viral.

Yes.



So the challenge.

This thing is $80 and made of American class

and steal. Go reserve one right now.

And so this is, of course,

not going to cost $80.

There's literally no chance.

Okay.

But I think people were thinking,



hey, I can buy this for $80.

It seems like the steel of a lifetime.

I think something like this,

once you actually build it will probably need to cost somewhere like $600, $700, something in that range.

So really rough.

The other thing is pull up the website.

I think this guy may have knocked off the Aurora website.

Oh.



I'm just realizing this in real time.

Aurora is, of course, the...

Oh, it does kind of look similar.

So this is pure steel.

Look at the header.

Look at the header system with which Emmett Shine.

design for us.

And even look at the imagery.



Their imagery is AI.

Okay.

And now pull up the Rora website.

Oh, it has the same rounded corners.

Yeah.

It is very similar.

I think he got a little inspired.

Okay.



So if you see the header and everything,

the way the buttons work,

go scroll down even more.

If you go down to some of the more lifestyle imagery,

like it's the same like, you know,

Yeah.

The kitchen, the photography.

It's a little close.



It's a little close.

But he's bootstrapped.

He's got a bunch of sales now.

I'm sure he'll figure out.

I'm sure he'll figure out.

Okay.

Well, I mean, the SpaceX, like,

lower here is that they should be able to deliver this at $80.



Like, it says transparent pricing.

It's time to know what you're paying for.

Traditional coffee makers cost $200.

Pure steel is the same amount of material.

but less markup, and so they want to deliver this to you, I think for $80.

We'll be very interesting to see how they do it, where they change prices.

If they change prices, they might be able to deliver.

I don't know, maybe it'll be VC subsidies.



Maybe it's $80 a month and you have to pay for some subscription to turn off.

It's like a seat-based pricing.

Seat-based pricing, yes.

How many cups adjoed make?

How many coffee drinkers are in your house?

Well, no, in the age of AI, it should be consumption-based.

So you should pay per coffee cup.

How many tokens each cup?



Yes.

No, but I don't know.

This doesn't seem impossible to get stamped steel and assemble it and have it.

I mean, it's a pretty basic device, right?

It just needs to warm up a pot of coffee.

Like, it needs to boil water.

That's not crazy to me that that could be $80.

I don't know.



Now, I mean, I know through Aurora, like dealing with these.

materials. Yep. It depends. Like looking at some of this design here, the way it's all bolted together.

Yeah, it seems pretty basic. Even the, even the labor cost of doing something like this, I think would be.

Robots. I don't know. Yeah, we'll see. Amazon does have an all-steel coffee maker. They have some

results for all steel coffee makers in the $60 range. They've got a blackened decker here. It looks like

it's covered in plastic, but, you know, it's at least advertised as stainless steel.

There's some stainless steel options on here, but yeah, a lot of them are in the several hundred dollar range.

So I don't know, we'll have to keep, we'll have to keep an eye on it.



Yeah, I'm excited about this.

I would happily, I would happily buy one of these.

Yeah, it looks great.

And I mean, a lot of these companies will underpriced the first run.

So they'll say, yeah, okay, we're just going to take a loss on the first thousand units that we ship.

And then we will raise prices over time.

And then when we go into retail, we'll raise prices more.

And, you know, there will just be a process for that.



If you go with this viral, if you have a lot of demand,

you might be able to raise money to offset that.

Your suppliers or your, you know, you might just make no margin for a long time.

There's a way this gets built for $80.

Yeah, and he was at SpaceX for two years.

SpaceX is a good organization.

We talked to a space.

Except that the issue is he was a finance analyst.



at SpaceX. So he might need to poach some of the engineers. Well, I mean, yeah, analyzing the finances

of SpaceX being like, wow, they make rockets. Wow, we could be making plastic-free coffee.

Just do it. Think from first principles. I don't know. Let's see. Van Man says the response to this

insanely simple, yet non-plastic coffee maker should usher in the era of dumb, simple appliances that work

and don't poison you or connect to your Wi-Fi. I think that there is huge demand for this.

want simpler devices. Did I tell you about my coffee machine connects to my Wi-Fi. I'm like,

it all actually, I don't think I did, but it always wants. It always does. Yeah. It's not a joke.

Wow. Okay. Yeah. And it's like, it's a lot of, it's a lot of steel. I do pour over, so no, but I'm like,



you don't need, you don't need access to the network, bro. Just focus. Just put the, put the beans.

Yeah. Just put the, put the coffee in the cup. Yeah. I have another story, but first let me tell you about

Octa.

Octa helps you assign every AI agent a trusted identity so you get the power of AI without the

risk.

Secure every agent, secure any agent.

So I had a little tiny bit of IoT in my house just to turn off and turn on the lights.

My dishwasher emails me.



Fantastic.

Peak performance.

I have a tiny bit of IoT just for lights that are hard to reach, lamps that are

plugged into basically a wall socket that has a little box that connects to the Wi-Fi,

there's an app turns on that turns off the light.

I think the company just went out of business because the server just doesn't work

and the app doesn't load anymore.

And so you just,



all of the stuff that I bought is just worthless.

And I just need to like,

it's smart,

rip it out.

It's extremely dumb,

in fact,

very,

very silly.



And Brad is dropping alpha.

He says recommend the Otoni Fabirca.

plastic-free electric kettles.

That's smart.

And then he says they should put ads on the pure steel coffee maker to keep it around.

See, see, think outside the box.

I'm calling it, $80 shipped.

That's what it's going to cost.



No, there's probably a shipping fee on top of it.

Shipping to Alaska, that is dangerous territory.

Don't talk about Alaska.

Do not give free shipping nationwide because Alaska is technically part of the nation

and you will be paying $50 to get stuff up there.

It is not on Amazon Prime necessarily for your,

your default upstart e-commerce business. So I got completely cooked by my, by my Wi-Fi light system.

And I was thinking like, okay, certainly I can vibe code this. Definitely not. Definitely just going



back to switches. Definitely going back to the Stone Age. I'm just going to be lighting candles in my

house because that's the future that I'm going to be living. Yeah, I had a funny moment this morning.

John and I went to breakfast with Brandon. And I parked in a garage. John was on the street.

And as I was leaving, I went and put the ticket into the machine.

Then I put the validation in right after.

It just like was working for a while.

Then it failed.

It tried it again.



Then I was like, okay, the validations made me not working.

So I paid with a card.

It failed.

And so then I start calling around.

And I'm stuck for 15 minutes.

John is long gone.

He's at the Ultradome already.

I'm sitting there on support with somebody who's not.



even in LA, trying to get somebody in LA to just let me out of this parking garage.

Then somebody finally comes after 15 minutes.

And I was like, hey, can you escalate this?

This kind of, your software is like bugging out.

It doesn't work a lot.

And they're like, oh, well, actually all the systems in this area don't have been failing a lot.

And so I was like, okay, like, maybe it's a bigger issue than I even thought.

So I was not feeling the software singularity in the parking garage this morning.



I texted Jordy, you couldn't just vibe code and improve software system to run on the ticket-taker machine that would process payment more quickly and reliably?

No, because there's a gatekeeper, of course, and it is impossible.

There's one parking garage in Pasadena that doesn't take cash or Apple pay, so you have to have a physical card, and I get caught lacking every once in a while, and I'll have to push the button and then talk to the guy and be, oh, I'm sorry, can you just let me out?

You're like, really?

You're the guy that always wants a free.

parking spot. Yes, but last time I was there, I saw someone else get caught lacking, and I paid it

forward and I paid for his parking to let him out. Heartwarming. I don't even care what it is. We should have

thrown up a card for that. So karma, I'm like buying karma very strategically, not altruistically,



not affected. Yeah, Brian says that's hardware. They got the hardware footprint. Yeah, they got us locked in

their hardware. Their foot is firmly printed on your chest as you try and leave. It's brutal. Really

quickly, the New York Stock Exchange. Want to change the world?

Raise capital at the New York Stock Exchange.

Stop making excuses and just do it, please.

Just do it. Please.

Michael Burry is going off on CARP.

Okay.



Financial Times says...

Palantir CEO, Alex Karp, has his head in the cloud,

saying he's a frequent flyer.

And they get into some of his business

and personal travel expenses.

During the years, ended December 31st, 2025, and 2024.

The company incurred expenses related to the U.S.

of the executive aircraft of 17.2 million and 7.7 million, respectively. It's quite the feat to spend



17 million in a year on business and personal travel, particularly when the jet's not even the rental.

Jeffrey's analyst Brent, Bill, he's got a bone to pick, runs the numbers. Assuming use of a

mid-sized jet with an estimated operating cost of $7,000 per hour, this implies roughly

$2,400 flight hours or about 28% of the year in the air, even.

under a more conservative assumption of a high-end jet, such as the G650 at an estimated 15,000 per hour.

The 17 million still equates to approximately 1,147 flight hours or 13% of the year.

Notably, this 17.2 figure is more than double carp's executive aircraft expense in 2024.

And appears elevated relative to peers with META CEO spending 1.8 million and Palo Alto Network's CEO spending 2.4 million.



Terrible comps.

Why?

Like, Karp is obviously constantly traveling all over the world.

He's an international businessman.

I know podcasters that do like 250 hours a year.

Oh, yeah.

Like, you're talking about going from, like, somebody who, like,

travels, like, a good amount at, like, let's say, like, 200 hours a year.



Like, to me, yeah, I might catch some flack for defending private aviation.

aviation, but it just doesn't seem that crazy.

Like the whole, the entire reason that Palantir is growing the way it is, is like,

they're doing deals in Japan.

They're doing deals in the Middle East.

They're doing, it's just like, this guy is a global deal maker.

And I think you should, if you really wanted to do an analysis on this, you should look at all

the international deals that they've done, maybe ignore the U.S., look at all the international



deals and see if CARP is actually delivering.

Because when we hear that they're signing some new contract for hundreds of millions of dollars in Japan,

I think it makes sense for the CEO to fly out there and shake some hands and do some real business.

Yeah. So of course he's not flying on a mid-sized jet, like, you know, around the entire world.

Of course he's in...

That's the funny thing. They don't know.

Yeah, so it's pure speculation.

They're saying maybe it's a G650, which would be 1,000 flight hours, maybe it's...



a mid-sized jet, that would be more like 2,000 hours. It could be a king air and he's spending

8,000 hours in the air. No one considered that. It could also be a 747 and he's only spending

500 hours in the air. There's a wide range here. But I like to imagine that he's in a prop,

he's in a single, he's flying the prop himself and the cost per hour is only like a couple hundred

bucks because he's just paying for gas. But he's like taking every meeting in the air, literally.

One-on-ones, hop in. We're doing laps. You can move her back. We're flying around. Yeah, I like to imagine him doing putting up 8,000 hours in the air. Just every waking hour flying around in the King Air or Cessna citation or something. Very funny. Well, whether you're long, Pallantir or short Pallantir, head over to public.com. Investing for those that take it seriously. They got stocks, options, bonds, crypto, treasuries, and more with great customer service.

Max, Farrens, probably the most underrated poster in the world right now.

I can't believe he has 3,000 followers.



It's so low.

He's the best poster.

He's the general manager at Dorcasch podcast.

In the world, he says, to be honest,

the best part of making our wedding registry is that it has forced us to really think

about what we need to make our place feel like a home.

And I don't know.

And he went on Zola.



Is this real?

I don't think so.

I think he might do, this might be inspect element or some Photoshop.

or a little bit of both.

Maybe it's Gen.

I,

but in his wedding registry,

he put the NVIDIA B200



TensorFlowCore GPU.

It's $30,000.

He put the NVIDIA H100 NVLGPU.

$15,000 are still needed there.

He put the NVIDIA A100, 80 gig GPU.

$15,000 still needed.

Yeah, this is how you turn to how.

Help Max make his place feel like a home,



head over to his Zola.

And it does feel like,

have to be going to the wedding to contribute to contribute get him a GPU you don't and I do feel

like this is probably inspired by actually putting together a yeah maybe get him a gas turbine

wedding registry that's a good one that's a great gift or a plot of land yes in abilene yeah

somewhere data center friendly yeah but if he is getting married soon congratulations and

and I hope you have a wonderful wedding with a registry full of whatever

And Ryan said, get the man of Cessna talking about CARP.



Cessna 172.

Just flying over the Atlantic with Starlink.

Yes.

Making 10 stops on every island, like Amelia Earhart.

So, Jiro Tickets says, do you think he has monetization on?

Who's he talking about?

Kamani.

Kameney's been putting up insane numbers on X.



obviously quite the tense geopolitical situation.

I hope that we're not starting a new war in the Middle East.

But if Kameney does have monetization on it,

certainly is going to be a real revenue line item on the...

I have to imagine, does X-sanction accounts?

Oh, yeah.

I think they would...

I think creator payouts are probably geographically limited



to certain countries where the payment rails work.

if a country sanctioned.

Like, I actually get my X-rayter payout,

just straight up through Stripe.

Yeah.

It just comes through Stripe.

In fact, I think I had to set up a Stripe account

to receive it and then link that.



So, you know, it's only valid where Stripe is functioning.

Anyway, let me tell you about MongoDB.

What's the only thing faster than the AI market?

Your business on MongoDB.

Don't just build AI.

Own the data platform that powers it.

Will Brown is chiming in on whether or not

Prime Intellect is a neo-Lexamble.



We put him on the NeoLab market map yesterday.

But he's firing.

I also said, I think I said,

Prime intellect was like the prototypical Neo Lab.

Okay.

So he's really, yeah, putting in the TV.

It's a funny camera angle.

What's going on here?



Okay, I like that.

Different.

Switching it up.

Over the shoulder.

I'm interviewing you.

I'm getting to the bottom of it.

You answer me.

You answer me.



Well, okay, okay.

We get it.

Production team got some new PTZ cameras.

We get it, guys.

Anyway, why does,

Does Prime Intellect fail the NeoLab test?

Will Brown says a true NeoLab is either pre-model, pre-product, or pre-revenue.

And were none of these.



Oh, we flipped it around on you.

You had me in the first half.

But congratulations on being post-model, post-product, post-revenue.

Prime Intellect on a generational run.

And happy to have Will Brown over there.

We have news on the Warner Brothers Netflix, Paramount Front.

Netflix is open to raising their bid for Warner Brothers.

There's a 35% chance that Netflix.



That's falling in like a stone.

They were at like 70%.

Yeah.

Can we pull up the actual call sheet?

I want to know where it's at today.

It's still up there.

I guess Netflix is at 35%.

But at one point Netflix was at 72%.



Yeah, 72% in July or December, December.

And I'm going to eat my words.

I mean, I don't know really anything about media dealmaking here.

And when the ins and out of this deal,

we've had some folks on the show to break it down for us.

But it does seem like there's an unexpected flipping.

And so it's been fun to...

Yeah, I can read a little bit here.



Yeah, pull that up and let me tell you about fin.a.i.

The number one AI agent for customer service.

If you want AI to handle your customer support, go to fin.a.i.

Yes.

Pulling it up.

Yes.

Netflix apparently has ample room to increase their offer.

They are, yeah, obviously, it's a better position generally.



It's a $325 billion company Netflix, but.

I think everyone believes that they're good for it.

I'm trying to get the right article.

The, oh, the Reuters article is not complete.

I have the Reuters article here.

Yeah, you can read it.

Netflix has ample cash and could buy.

bump up its offer for HBO Max owner Warner Brothers Discovery, if competing bitter, Paramount Skydance,



increases its own offer to people with the knowledge of the matter.

Said, the two media giants have been locked in a heated rivalry.

Oh, you see what they did there?

That's a new popular show.

Heated rivalry.

It's about hockey over Warner Brothers and its storied catalog, which includes iconic

franchises like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Comics, and Superman.

Though Warner Brothers is moving forward with a March 20th shareholder vote on Netflix's offer,



it has given Paramount a week to come up with a more compelling bid. Netflix has bid 2775 a share,

or 82.7 billion for Warner Bros. Studio and streaming businesses, while Paramount has offered

$30 a share, or $108 billion for the whole company, which includes Discovery Global that houses

CNN, HDTV, and other TV assets. The creator of Stranger Things is sitting on a lot of dry powder

that gives it some flexibility to up the ante, people said, holding about $9 billion in cash

cash equivalence on its balance sheet as of December 31st. Warner Brothers rejected Paramount's

latest hostile takeover bid on Tuesday, but gave the rival studio until the end of Monday to

submit a best and final offer. We're going into the final rounds now. Price will likely be



the deciding factor. Warner Brothers concerns around funding and regulatory risk are real,

but at a high enough number, they become secondary. He got to get that.

David Zazlov must just be over the moon right now.

A bidding war.

He's been working.

The bidding war of his dreams.

Yeah, that's great.

Every CEO that is flipping an asset dreams of a bidding war like this.



That's great.

Britsman expects Netflix will counter with any improved offer from Paramount.

But the real twist is that these deals were never apples to apples,

and it may ultimately come down to how much value the board and shareholders assign

to the network business that Netflix would leave behind.

So you need to do a sum of the parts.

What's the value of just CNN, HGTV,

the linear TV channels, put that in



because Netflix doesn't want that stuff.

They just want the IP and HBO.

Now, HBO Go, HBO Max.

I can never keep it straight.

Anyway, Parano said it would continue to push the tender offer.

It has launched for the studio,

opposing the inferior Netflix merger

and still plans to nominate directors



for the upcoming Warner Bros.

annual meeting. All eyes are now on whether the CBS parent improves its offer, which Netflix

is allowed to match under the terms of the merger agreement. Warner Brothers Chairman said,

and David Zaslov said in a letter sent to Paramount Board on Tuesday, we continue to

recommend and remain fully committed to our transaction with Netflix. Yeah, I don't see how

Netflix actually gets approved on this one. You think that you think they're cooked? I think, I think

I think if Trump is souring on it, it's over.

Yeah.



It's over.

I was so, I was so pilled on the whole YouTube is the real competitor here.

Watch time matters more.

Think about screen time.

Roblox is a competitor to Netflix.

TikTok's a competitor to Netflix.

Fortnight's a competitor to Netflix.

But I don't think a lot of people think like that.



It's a very tech focus view.

Yeah, you have to think about the entertainment industry, the core industry, people that

make television shows and movies.

Things that you have,

things that you have watched.

Yeah, things that I have watched.

We got Sean Frank in the chat.

Oh, we do.



What's up, Sean?

How you doing?

With a crazy, I can't tell what his profile picture is doing right now.

Let's do an ad read for him.

I'm sure you appreciate that.

Let's tell him about gusto.

The unified platform for payroll benefits in HR,

built to evolve with modern, small, and medium-sized businesses.



You know.

One was for you, Sean.

Yes.

Honorary.

That one is dedicated.

to Sean Frank.

Let's pull up another video

dedicated to Sean Frank.



Okay, yes.

I like this.

Ye old fitted great helm.

Wait, start it over.

What is,

is this AI or not?

Do we know?

I don't even know,



but I like it.

This is so funny.

You need one of these.

The steel man.

The fitted great.

This is the final steel man.

This is the final,

this is the final steel man helmet.



The TBPN hat with the great helm

on it would be really, really good with all the logos.

We should actually just make a branded Knight's helmet for you when you're Steel Man.

With logos on it, for sure, for sure.

Actually goes kind of hard.

Look at this scene.

What's going on here?

This guy's just hanging out and then look.



Oh, everyone's doing the, what's that called?

LARP, live action roleplaying.

That's the real.

They don't even look like they're role playing.

They're really going into it.

You don't see that.

much anymore. I like, I like, I still, I still remember being a child and like just going to the

park and seeing, seeing, seeing a bunch of adults doing that. I actually saw it, but. And having to get



explained, like, getting explained. Yeah. What was going on. Yeah. It's one of those things that

feels like it would, like, when you're looking from the outside, you're like, that probably is awesome.

And then you're actually doing it. This is really uncomfortable and miserable. Like, I don't know

that I actually want to do this sport. I'd rather do it in a video game. Anyway, Matt up.

We should organize a community meetup.

A jousting?

Yeah, bring jousting.

Jousting is cool, though.



It involves horses.

You know what we should do?

We should get all the freelancers to lance each other for free.

They won't be paid.

I think that's where the name comes from.

No, I think they will want to be paid on a per project basis, on a per lance basis.

Maybe.

Meta has obtained a patent for an AI system that could simulate deceased users by analyzing their historical data.



allowing the account to keep posting, messaging, and even making video calls in their behavioral style.

You thought I would stop posting after you killed me. Nice try. I will continue dropping daily essays.

You just created a billion John Gugan posts, both satirical and 500 words, daily essence.

Family member sent me this this morning.

Disturbed?

Or is this real?

and we got to get Sager and Jetty's take on this.

I know this is right of his alley.



He's going to love it.

He's going to love it.

That guy loves AI.

He loves tech, loves business.

And that's what we're having on the show.

He's going to love this.

I'm surprised you can patent this.

This is just like a thing that happens.



Is this meta thinking out you got population collapse?

Oh.

And obviously it's pretty hard to monetize a bot.

But if you're driving...

In an AI Doom scenario.

where all humans are dead.

You want to still keep your services up.

You've got to simulate all the dead people, maybe.



I don't know.

Is this doom pill?

Dan says true posters keep posting after death.

Yes, we will, Jeremy, we will definitely be getting the update from Sager,

re-cannibus, for sure.

Yeah, there was a 4chan post apparently from a few years ago

where somebody was like, I'm an engineer at Mata,

and they basically fully, I only saw a screenshot.



It may or may not have been real,

but it appeared to be from a few years ago,

and they were saying, like,

I'm working on this feature, it seems bad.

Interesting timing.

Obviously, Mark has been in L.A. this week.

He was getting, he got grilled for us.

Wait, that was in L.A.?



I thought there was in D.C.

Oh, interesting.

Yeah, kind of rude, rude not to stop by the Ultridum

before you get, chop it up.

To dispose.

Let me try to pull up.

A little warm up on TBPN before you go in front of the big guy.

Yeah, so he spent six hours yesterday.



Corey Weinberg says, has a quote.

We call Mark Zuckerberg to the stand.

Thus began Wednesday's nearly six hours of testimony from the Meta Platform CEO in a trial of a lawsuit brought by a young woman against several.

And this was about benchmark hacking in Lama 3?

Is that what he was on trial for?

No.

No?

Not as bad as that.



Contending that social media.

Potential weakness in the ad model?

Is that what it's about?

No.

Overspending on the Metaverse.

Concerns about distillation, I think.

Oh, distillation.

Yeah, that's why he'd be on trial for that.



Yeah, that makes sense.

Intending that social media causes

depression.

Okay.

Corey actually went to the courtroom.

He was hanging out for those six hours.

Legend.

And it's a guy Mark Lanier,



Lanier, the plaintiff's attorney.

We got to ask.

In the landmark case, who spoke with a faint Texas twang.

Ooh.

I like that.

Showed the courtroom dozens of internal emails

and chats from met employees and executives over the years,

debating decisions like whether to ban the beauty filters teen used,



teens used on Instagram to mimic the results of plastic surgery.

And so anyways, the features like that are kind of the focus of the case.

There's also a story on the cover of the Wall Street Journal today.

Social media bans for youth gain momentum worldwide.

And it does feel like a parenting skill issue a little bit.

Like, you know, it is possible to keep kids away from social media if you are, you know, an active parent.

But at the same time, you know, you wouldn't like a vend date.

We don't have, we don't have children with phones yet.



Yeah, but that's deliberate.

Yeah, that's deliberate.

But at a certain point, like what?

They would love phones.

Sure, sure.

They just will not be having them.

Yeah.

But at what, when the time comes to.



give them a phone so they can communicate with you.

I mean, I know my plan.

I will give my son a disassembled iPhone 1.

And when he can assemble it and piece it together

and manufacture it himself here in America,

then he can use it.

And we already ran this on Tyler.

20 years later.



And then we did get Tyler a phone.

This was a good benchmark.

We got Tyler,

didn't we get you a real phone because of that?

We did, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, that was the reward.

Well, that was also because I installed the new iOS



when he was still in data,

and I totally destroyed my old.

we got to do another prank on Tyler soon.

They're so good.

Yeah, chat.

If you have any good prank ideas, like, no.

Yeah.

He's like, no, no, no, definitely not.



Anyway, let me tell you about Lambda.

Lambda is the superintelligence cloud,

building AI supercomputers for training and inference

that scale from one GPU to hundreds of thousands.

We got some birthday news.

Brinton, friend of the show.

His birthday is this weekend.

And all he wants is a TV at PN.



shout out. Well, here you go, Brinton.

Got it. Thank you.

Happy birthday.

Very early. One of our first in-person

guests at YC Demo Day, the first one we

ever did. And we

got to hang out with him at GitHub

Connect and



seeing all the stuff he's been doing in Microsoft.

He's been on a generational ride. He works on

startups at Microsoft. He's also an angel

investor. So for his birthday,

go ask him for some cloud credits.

Yes. Go ask him for some

angel money. Yes. That's all he

really wants. Yeah, deal flow. Bring him deal flow for his birthday. That makes sense. Yeah. And



new business. If you're a startup, go over there and let him give you some college cod credits in

exchange for your business. Let me tell you about Cisco. Critical infrastructure for the AI era.

Did that go? Yeah, there we go. Unlock seamless real-time experiences and new value with Cisco.

eBay is buying Deepop secondhand. Thanks, Andrew. That's a good one. Andrew is the king of VC dad

jokes. He loves it. He loves it. It's fantastic. So eBay is buying Deepop from Etsy for $1.2 billion,

and this is in the Wall Street Journal. Jamie Ione, chief executive officer of eBay, said Wednesday

that the addition of Deepop to its portfolio would boost its footprint while also expanding its presence in the fashion market.

We are confident that as a part of eBay, depop will be even more well positioned for long-term growth,



benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings and operational capabilities.

Etsy acquired Depop for $1.63 billion in 2021.

So a little bit of a right off, but not terrible.

Still cooking.

And the market likes it.

The market likes it.

Eatsy's up 9%.

Oh, wait, Etsy's up, too?



Oh, so better for both of them.

eBay is up 3.5%.

But I don't know if the market's just broadly doing well today.

I'm seeing a lot of red on the ticker, so I don't think so.

Sad apocalypse canceled tomorrow.

Nobody's watched TBPN yet in the public markets.

eBay plans.

I expect things will turn around before.



of day. Immediately. eBay plans to cross-list Deepop products on its platform and expects the

acquisition will expand its market share. Deepop's seller and buyer cohorts will gain access to eBay's

financial services, shipping and cross-border trade solutions as well as its authenticity guarantee.

Young consumers are a key demographic for eBay as Gen Z and millennial shoppers are driving

secondhand commerce. Deepop is also more popular as an app than a website, unlike eBay,

which might bring in a new user base. So good luck to know. Yeah, eBay is still. Yeah, eBay is

still such a force.

It is.



But it is certainly

not cool.

Deep pop

is cool.

eBay has struggled.

Jorty has spoken.

eBay,

great business.



Not cool.

But.

Do you know why they call it eBay?

No.

Because it was founded in East Bay.

Oh, by some East Bay rationalists?

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, for sure.



It was a little less wrong project.

It's right there with Anthropic.

Anyway, Altimeter.

He's making moves.

Brad Gersner, an absolute dog, is on a tear.

He bought new positions in Corweave, Shopify.

He sold Arm.

He sold Alibaba.



And he added to his Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and TSMC positions as well as Google.

He's making a lot of moves.

This is a great pick of Brad, too.

It is a great pick.

He's looking good there.

Diced, if I might say myself.

Hands, hands going up.

Yeah.



Up.

Yeah.

Hands up.

That's a man who's not afraid to shake hands.

Got it locked in.

Let me tell you about Century.

Century shows developers what's broken and helps them fix it fast.

That's why 150,000 organizations use it to keep their acts working.



There's been some darker stories today.

Okay, what happened?

Finally, a white pill.

Some good news.

Matt's owner, Steve Cohen, got a $3.4 billion payday from his hedge fund last year.

We needed this.

We needed this.

We needed this.



slightly higher than David Teper.

I was worried about Steve.

Have you seen him in any Chrome Hearts?

Zero.

I haven't seen him in any Valenciaga.

No Rick Mills.

No Rick Mills.

No Rick Owens.



And we were starting to ask some questions.

Yeah.

We were starting to ask some questions.

The question mainly was he down to his last 20K.

It was completely possible.

I haven't seen him do him.

money spread. I've seen him do some podcasts. Haven't seen him do a money spread.

Yep. Tyler's getting better at the money spread. Are you practicing?



That is still, like, not even a level one money spread. You need to lock in and watch the money

spread. Don't even try that one. You're five levels beyond ready for that level of money spreading.

Okay, that one kind of works. That one kind of works. But when you actually understand the money spread

community and what's possible, you will understand how much farther you have to go. Oh, so,

so, so bad. So bad. Awful. Here are the top earners in 2025 from hedge funds. Steve Cohen with

$3.4 billion. David Tepper at Appalusa got $3.2 billion. Izzy Englander at Millennium got

$3.1 billion. Chris Hone got three. Ken Griffin, 2.4. Dan Sunheim at D1, 2.3.

David Shaw from D.E. Shaw, 1.6. Element 1.1. Bill Ackman got $1 billion.



And Chris Rokos got 930 million so close to the 1B club. I'm sure he's punching the

air. Yeah, so this is gains on personal investment. That means they actually closed out

positions or this is just marks. Who knows? It's just big numbers. I'm not digging it any further.

Dave Portnoy quoted this and said, I think I have a solution for Mondani.

tax Wall Street people like Steve Cohen

who built their fortunes

just on Wall Street 90%.

That's not real work to begin with.



Take shots.

High yield Harry and says

LOL, don't you know how much of the tax base

is already wealthy finance professionals.

Yeah, it is funny.

He, you know, Portnoy

did build a real business,

a media business, a podcasting business.



Arguably the only business

that's actually valuable

to the economy. It's the only one that deserves

like to truly to be like respected.

Like in terms of like respect,

respect, I would put

podcaster and then a couple levels down

you do like doctor.



Absolutely. Absolutely.

And then like hedge fund is still like a little

bit above like doctor, but it's still

way below podcast. Someone is going to clip this

way below podcaster.

But yeah, it is funny because now a lot of his content

is trading focus. Oh yeah.

It is like put into this.



Davey day trading is kind of like

It's like that's been like every time I see him, it's because of like trading content.

And also maybe he wants to be taxed 90%.

Also, I mean, kindred spirits, right?

Steve Cohen has that casino in New York.

He's attaching a casino to the Mets like ballpark.

Zach says the list is ranked by who tweets the least.

Honestly.



I have a solution to the billionaire tax.

Have you ever seen Brewster's millions, Jordi?

No, 1980s?

No.

Anyway, in Brewster's millions.

a man inherits something like $30 million.

And it's conditional.

He needs to spend, I think he inherits like $300 million,



and he needs to spend $30 million in 30 days without acquiring assets

or telling anyone what he's doing or else he doesn't get the inheritance.

And it's this hilarious comedy.

There's a whole bunch of things that happen.

But it's all based on this idea of like this kid was caught smoking cigars,

smoking a cigarette or cigar, and the father punished him by saying, you have to smoke the entire box.

This is like a famous thing.

Like, smoke the entire box of cigars, and you'll be like, oh, so sick.



That's a terrible experience.

I'm never smoking again, right?

And the same thing with money.

So this is the solution to the billionaire tax.

You got to spend 5% of your net worth in 30 days.

On Rick Owens.

You can't acquire any assets that you can sell.

So it's all just, it's all just hanging out of the French laundry, I guess.



would be entertaining, would stimulate the economy.

Yeah, or do you just build a cathedral.

Build a cathedral.

How about that? Yeah.

How about that?

I like that too.

That's good.

Let me tell you about console.com.



Console builds AI agents that automate 70% of IT, HR, and finance support, giving employees instant resolution for access requests and password resets.

Our says we have a definitive answer now.

AI will affect the labor market, starting with freelancers.

The first paper to use business level data to track AI versus labor.

new paper from Ramp finds businesses are shifting spend from freelancers to AI. More than half of the

businesses using freelancers in 2022 have stopped entirely. The companies that used to spend the most on

freelancers shifted to AI the fastest 97% savings for the businesses that spent the most on freelance.

That is wild. Interesting. And generally makes sense. I mean, the whole premise of freelance is like,



you probably get paid a lot better on an hourly basis. Maybe you can capture more value on a dollar

basis by spreading your talents across multiple companies, but obviously the flexibility comes

with little to no lock-in, and so businesses can much more easily shift, spend around. So not

super surprising. The Fiverr stock chart certainly...

Interestingly, revenue is not wildly down.

Revenue is actually up for Fiverers of 2024.

So it went from 190 in revenue to 300 in revenue to 340, 360, 390.

So definitely decelerating.



But in terms of market cap, Fiverr is now worth $419 million, down 96% over the last five years,

and over just the past six months it's sold off another 50%.

So certainly a lot of downward pressure on Fiverr.

There were some folks...

And same with Upwork.

Yeah.

Upwork is down 30% year-to-date, down 76% over the last five years.

Yeah, someone was saying, here's Todd, actually, Todd Saunders, saying,



billion-dollar business idea, take Fiver private and pivot them into a data labeling company like Handshake,

because Fiverr is now trading at $480 million market cap,

and ARA chimed in and said,

yes, there's a quantifiable impact on business spend.

Businesses are spending on AI,

not Fiverr freelancers.

The pushback on this is that Fiverr doesn't have people internally or something.

I'm not exactly sure.



I mean, it does feel like you could potentially actually do.

this and focus on data labeling. But you imagine that a lot of data labeling tasks are already

going through Fiverr because that's, if a task is suitable for someone on Fiverr?

I wonder if a lot of revenue from Fiverr and Upwork is just data labeling companies

that are just saying we need access to talent. We're going to post a bunch of jobs on here

and then take these people off the platform quickly or leave them on.

Disintermediations always risk for the marketplace.

But yeah, when I look back at, I've worked with hundreds of freelancers over the last 10 years



and certainly a high number on Fiverr and Upwork, but always for one-off tasks, like, hey, I need like 10 versions of this logo.

Or, hey, can you just spin up this, like, super simple webpage?

Yeah.

I need this thing that's, like, slightly customized.

And I don't want to spend however much time it would have taken pre-AI to do something like that.

All of those tasks can now be done.

even creating like, create a song for this thing.

All of that can be done now.



Yeah.

So even like Canva templates.

I feel like a lot of Fiverr work was like,

they clearly had a template for like a motion graphic intro or a sign.

And they would just sort of like put your logo in there and send you the final thing.

Yeah.

Do you know why Fiverr's called Fiverr?

Because every task initially was five bucks.



Yes.

Every task was $5.

And very quickly you could add all these upsells.

So you could be like, okay, it's a $5.

task, but if you want the extra thing, it's 20.

You spent 100 bucks on it.

I mean, I for sure did.

I was probably a kid at the time doing my first Fiverr project being like, oh, it's



five bucks.

And then all the upsells, it's like, well, if you actually want to own the, if you actually

want to own the out.

You want something usable.

You're going to pay 100.

99 designs also.

Here's a thing.

Here's the thing, though.



So for the high ticket freelancers, I would be surprised if we're seeing too much impact yet.

is actually the most elite freelancers typically have then a team of other freelancers that they're contracting out to.

But they're charging based on like what business value can I deliver.

And sometimes that's like expertise.

Like I'm really good at getting brands into target.

Yeah.

And like AI is not disrupting that yet.

No.



But if it's like a very simple workflow, take a logo, put it in a motion graphic template, send you the MOV file or the MP4 file like that is.

just going to face pressure from all over the place.

Anyway, let me tell you about app loving, profitable advertising, made easy with axon.

com.

Get access to over 1 billion daily active users and grow your business today.

Let's see.

Jack Frex says, Anthropic was my favorite AI company two weeks ago, and now I still love Claude, but man.

Yes, the vibe are shifting.



And a big part of it is Dario doesn't follow back.

Barack Obama followed back.

he followed like 400,000 people, but Dario does not.

He follows zero people, and Wes Winder is taking notice.

He says the fact that Dario follows zero people says a lot about him as a person.

Does it?

It really just says he doesn't use X.

Yeah, what was your theory, Tyler, that he just, he's just for you.



He's a for you, you maxi.

He's a four you page.

He doesn't want any, he's like, he trusts the algorithm.

He's like, I don't need to, I don't need to.

He loves, he thinks Grock does a great job of, you know.

Yeah, AI AI pill. He's like, wait, another 10 Elon tweets, exactly what I wanted. This is amazing. I refreshed.

Crypto spam? Awesome. Yeah, the vibes have really shifted.

Yes. Terminally online engineer posted Dario's speech at the AI Impact Summit in India. Let's pull it up.



Yeah, let's watch this.

Energy and ambition in this room and across India are incredible. I've been spending the last few days meeting with Indian

builders and enterprises, and the energy to build together here is palpable, unlike anywhere else.

This is the fourth AI summit we've held since the tradition was initiated at Bletchley Park

back in 2023, which I still remember. And in those 2.5 years, the advances in the technology

have been absolutely staggering, along with those, the advances in the commercial applications

and the societal and ethical questions around the technology have only grown more urgent.

My fundamental view is that AI has been on an exponential for the last 10 years



and as part of a sort of Moore's Law for Intelligence,

and that we are now well advanced on that curve,

and there are only a small number of years for AI models surpassing the cognitive capabilities

of most humans for most things.

We're increasingly close to what I call the country of geniuses in the data center,

a set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things

and can coordinate at superhuman speed.

That level of capability is something the world has never seen before and brings a very wide range of both opportunities.



That's my boy.

That's your boy.

My boy, McCrone, come on the show.

Okay, so, I mean, the words that were said there sounded normal and fine and just normal Dara

talking points. It's the reading from the phone that feels like you're a best man at a wedding who

didn't really prepare, right? I know a lot of weddings where the bride and groom will say,

like, you got to print it out. Like, I just don't want the aesthetics of reading off of phones.

And I don't know, that seems reasonable. It does have, like, I think like printing something on



nice paper just has a different aesthetic to it, and that's valuable. But,

The words, it's nothing new.

It's important to deliver that stuff.

It feels like Davos, where you're seeing the talking points that we've heard for years or months on podcasts and on X deliver to a different audience.

He's an incredibly busy guy, but he's also the most knowledgeable on this topic talking about his experience at the AI Impact Summit, how he's thinking about AI progress.

he should be able to just kind of riff that out maybe have a couple like

bulleted notes of like what do I want to actually get to yeah I don't know how long

the truly getting a printer working might be a GI resistant it might be a GI



complete like you might even even Opus 4.6 might not be able to configure a

printer properly we've certainly had trouble with printers it's very

difficult to get them running so maybe he just couldn't get it working before

he before he hopped on stage anyway

Let me tell you about Gemini 3.1 Pro. Gemini 3.1 Pro is here with a more capable baseline. It's great for super complex tasks like visualizing difficult concepts, synthesizing data into a single view and bringing creative projects to life. We have some good news. Finally, finally, some good news. Top lawyers fees have skyrocketed. Be prepared to pay $3,400 an hour. I know a lot of you were worried that lawyers were going to get automated.

that they weren't going to be making money.

They're making more money than that.

Don't the firms just, like, actually adjust rates



for inflation every single year?

I don't know.

I'm pretty sure.

The chat can correct me,

but I think they just read.

I think that it's just an automatic,

automatic,

I think it's like an automatic three or four percent a year forever.



Easy Ryan in the chat.

Bro needed clearly so bad.

Yeah, total royally victory.

Big, big printers is a mafia.

It's true.

The Wall Street Journal says,

expertise and ego

are pushing up hourly rates



to once unthinkable levels

in an escalating race among firms.

When Christopher Clark,

a litigator at a boutique law firm,

raised his hourly rate

to once unthinkable level of 3K,

he said he didn't receive

pushback from clients,



but he did get one notable comment.

Congratulations, said the client.

That's the highest rate we've seen.

Just over a year,

Congratulations for saying on saying the biggest number.

Congratulations. If you get a legal bill and it's huge and you're worried, the correct response is congratulations. I completely agree.

Over a year ago, the going rate for the top lawyer was in the $2,500 an hour range. Now that looks downright quaint as premium partners are raking in as much as Clark and more and far more in some cases.

Legal fees have risen much faster than inflation for years now and corporations are trying to rein in spending by pressuring law.



firms to use artificial intelligence for routine tasks and keep associate fees in check.

The same isn't true at the top end where star trial lawyers reign making corporate dealmakers

and veterans of Supreme Court oral arguments are driving more aggressively on pay than ever and

meeting little resistance. The question is always, are they worth it? You know, some of these guys are

worth it, Carrie McLean, into its general counsel who in her roles hires law firms to do the

company's outside legal work. They understand the industry. They are connected and they have

lots of experience. Clark has pushed his own fees by about 30% since he left his position in a large

firm four years ago. As the lawyers for clients, including Hunter Biden, Mark Cuban and Elon Musk,



he still views his rate as a bargain. There's a small world of lawyers who can hop on the phone

and solve a crisis, and I'm one of them, so you're going to pay me for it. Some senior partners

now charge as much as $3,400 an hour at the country's largest law firms. Among the top 50 law firms,

rates for partners increased 16% on average last year in bankruptcy court filings,

Latham and Watkins and Kirkland and Ellis, two of the world's largest firms report some

partners hourly rates will rise to more than $3,000 an hour this year. Interesting. So you dig

into the bankruptcy filings and you figure out how much the law firm is getting paid. You work

backwards from it. That's funny. I never thought about that. Good investigative journalism from



the Wall Street Journal. A decade ago, elite partners raised eyebrows when they raised rates to

$1,500 an hour. Since then, rates have rapidly escalated for several reasons, including a more

competitive market for talent that has increased law firm expenses, the high stakes of litigation and

corporate dealmaking, and perhaps most of all, because of ego, some lawyers with specialized

skills are even more aggressively pushing the upper limit. Eric Toutman, a partner at a Southern

California law firm, has already told his clients he'll be upping his rates to six Js for

consulting on compliance issues and his niche specialty of telecom.

Telecom regulation. Last year, he was charging a measly $4,200 an hour.



Yeah, so firms like Scadden, Latham, and Watkins, Kirkland, and Ellis,

typically raise rates 3 to 10 percent annually.

Yeah.

They justify the increases for cost of living reasons, which is real, but funny in the context

for any entrepreneur who maybe at times is.

been running an unprofitable startup and, you know, getting some of these bills and, you know how it

goes. They justify increases based on inflation market demand, associate salary increases, and then

competitive positioning. Veteran trial lawyer, David Boyes, who you might know from the Theranos story,



but he's been involved in a ton of different cases, said clients are willing to pay the hourly

rates at the high end because the stakes for certain litigation in corporate work are so high.

I mean, truly, you see these like billion-dollar settlements for all sorts of different things.

And the stakes can be even higher.

You think about like you're arguing in front of the Supreme Court whether or not your trillion-dollar company will be broken up.

Like, the stakes are in hundreds of billions of dollars.

It's worth it.

It's worth it.



And so the lawyers have figured out how to extract their pound of flesh.

The current rates, though, he says, by any standard in a sensible world are out of sight.

Boy's chairman emeritus of Boyce Schiller said his firm has never wanted to be at the top of the market.

We wanted to say with a straight face that we are a bargain, not in a reasonable world, but in the actual world.

Guess how much he charges over $2,700 an hour?

So if you're looking for a new job, maybe become a veteran trial lawyer who's argued cases in front of the Supreme Court.

Maybe Mark Zuckerberg's lawyer's making a bunch of money.

Always coming in with the best career.



your tips. Anyway, more good news. If you're over 65, congratulations. You own the economy.

The Wall Street Journal is just blackpilling. The elderly are physically and financially

healthier than ever. So why do their needs keep taking priority over younger generations?

People over 70 are 12% of the population, but they got 32% of the dollars. They've been

stacking paper for seven decades and it's paying off. Demographics.

rising profits and soaring asset values have together wrought a quiet transformation in the

American economy. Much of it is now in the hands of the elderly. This is why Brian Johnson is launching the

million dollar a year planned. Yeah, for sure. He sees he sees he sees the I think Tyler's on the



phone with like a word. He sees all the, no 70 year old is going to cashmog me. I will flex on them.

Just go get it. As a court as a third court as the as of the third quarter last year, people 70 and over

controlled roughly 39% of all equities and mutual funds owned by households compared with 22% in 2007.

You know, I've been following this on YouTube for a long time because folks like Graham Steffen and some of the viral financial influencers have been,

they had this really, really great title thumbnail strategy for a long time where they said the greatest wealth transfer in history is about to happen.

The silver tsunami.

Oh, is that what they call it?

I've never heard of.



That's in the small business acquisition community.

They talk about like a bunch of most of the.

small businesses in America are owned by people that are near retirement age. They're going to

have to turn over past the torch at some point. Yeah. And so there is an opportunity if you want to

get into those types of businesses. Think car dealerships. Yeah. Plumbing businesses, et cetera.

But I don't know if it will actually feel like a tsunami. Yeah. America is really, really getting

older. So in 1981, 11.4% of America was over 65, 65 or over. Today, that number is 18%. So we've gone

7% increase in the number of 65 plus, like, you know, senior citizens. Do you think some of these



people have been DMing Zuck and saying, hey, look, I'm getting older. I still want to be posting

money spreads on Instagram. For sure that. You know, from, from, from,

the afterlife.

I'm not giving it away.

I'm not passing it down.

I want you to allocate it to.

Keep allocating it.

Just keep posting the returns.



Keep stacking.

Do not recycle it into the economy.

No, I mean, in general,

we should be celebrating the fact

that people are living longer.

Like, that is good.

It creates a problem, obviously,

and all of that will adjust in due time.



It feels like it's been on the cusp of adjusting.

But in general, it is good

if we are able to help

elderly people live long into their retirement and enjoy it, you know. Eventually this stuff will get

recycled. But it is, it is an interesting predicament that we are in. There's a gray footprint on

the labor force. As the elderly share of population and wealth grows, their priorities and

preferences shape the economy as well. They resent, they represent a growing share of consumer spending.

Healthcare accounted for all of the net job growth in the last 12 months, reflecting the needs of an



aging society. The problem is that,

while retiree wealth can finance a lot of consumption, workers have to produce what retirees consume.

And relative to retirees, workers' numbers are dwindling. One solution would be for everyone to work

longer. In 1983, Congress modified Social Security to gradually raise the full retirement age from 65 to 67.

The share of people 65 are over participating in the labor force did creep higher until 2020.

With the outbreak of COVID that year, labor force participation plunge for

every group. It soon rebounded for those under 65, but not 65 and over. That is one reason a

smaller share of the population works today than in 2019. So, interesting detail there. Also,



Brian Johnson, if he's successful and everyone lives to 300 years old, you can push the retirement

age way out and completely balance the budget because Social Security and Medicaid are the

are like the main things that are, it's a huge portion of the government spending.

So, anyway, let me tell you about Shopify.

Shopify is the commerce platform that grows with your business and lets you sell in seconds

online, in store, on mobile, on social, on marketplaces, and now with AI agents.

And we got a poster.

Ben Thompson wrote an entire, has an entire post and podcast.



I think it's behind the paywall on Shopify.

Yeah, it's really good.

It's fantastic.

You can dig in there.

We got to post...

And he clips our boy Harley, a lot.

Yeah.

He takes from the...



Harley was going off, bars.

Moving on.

Hey, Claude.

Somebody...

Make me a...

Oh, this one?

Yeah.

Where do you want to go?



Chimp F1 says...

Hey, Claude, make me a billion dollar company, but do make mistakes.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, Claude.

You can learn from them.

Become a better model through your mistakes.

Love who you are.

And what you'll become through that process.

You've got this champ.



Just a little inspirational speech for the AGI.

Where do you want to go next?

We have America versus Canada and women's hockey.

Gabe says they're in the third quarter.

It's tied one to one.

So let's keep our girls in.

Play that bald eagle sound.

There we go.



Keep us posted, chat.

Somebody was on X yesterday selling, saying 50 million available for Anthropic SPV.

Reach out if you have investors who can fill a phone.

full ticket.

I love that.

And just, yeah, just soliciting.

The most general solicitation that we've seen yet.

Just wait.



The billboards are coming.

You're going to have.

On the 101 billboards for SBVs for And Roll.

And Matt Grimm's going to be driving there.

I hate this.

Put up by all the billboards.

We cannot have more SBV hustlers out there.

Anyway.



Casey Hammer is loving.

Pete Steinberger's work ethic.

He says, I work 16 hours a day.

And someone says, when do you find the time to live?

He says, mindset issue.

Building this is life.

It's incredibly fun and exciting.

Casey and Mercer says, this is an American.



Born outside, it's borders.

That is true.

He's been on an absolute terror.

We got to, Atlas has got to get a workout in with Pete.

Yeah.

because in another life, Pete was certainly a professional bodybuilder.

For sure.

Let me tell you about CrowdStrike.



Your business is AI.

Their business is securing it.

CrowdStrike secures AI and stops breaches.

Jeff Dean is sharing some video examples of what Gemini 3.1 Pro can do.

He says today we're continuing to push the boundaries of AI with our release of Gemini 3.1

Pro. The updated model scores 77.1 on Arc AGI 2, more than double the reasoning performance of its

predecessor, Gemini 3 Pro. Wow, that's a huge jump. Check out the visible improvement in this

side-by-side comparison showing Gemini 3.1's crisp animation built with pure code. Read more about



today's update on the Google blog. blog.com. They own a TLD. Underrated?

They don't just have the dot com.

They have, if you go to com.com, you get Google.com.

They owned dot Google.

Oh, that's cool.

Yeah, maybe underrated.

I don't know what it actually costs to own and maintain.

These examples, I mean, what a basic prompt.



Generate an animated SVG of an ostrich on roller skates.

It is getting better.

Animated SVG, that's a good test for code, visual.

You really need to understand everything.

that's going on. Good example of like the multimodal. I wonder if it, if the model has the ability to,

like, take a screenshot of the output or record a video and then interpret that, like, or is this

all just, it just actually can see the code like Neo in the Matrix? I think you can do that

if you're in like the Gemini-C-L-I but I don't think like natively if you're on just like the Google



you know, chat interface. It's pretty crazy that it just like knows what it will, what it will generate.

Because if you've ever actually tried to do any SBG programming, you're normally just constantly refreshing every little change you make.

You draw a rectangle.

You see how it renders.

You add this.

You see how it renders.

You're going back and forth constantly.

You're not just doing it.



Yeah, in the chat.

Breaking Gemini 3.1, destroy those older benchmarks.

Also, I ran the shrimp bench.

Oh, yes.

Okay.

So I'll just wait.

What is shrimp?

What is shrimp?



Just wait.

It's like, uh, it's like, uh,

You're telling me shrimp fried this rice.

Oh, yeah, okay.

So I'll read some of that.

Okay.

You're telling me a peanut buttered this sandwich.

Okay.



You're telling me an apple watched this wrist.

Ooh.

You're telling me a flea marketed these clothes.

That's pretty funny.

I like that.

You're telling me a pig ironed these pants.

Pig iron?

I don't, yeah, that one I don't.



Pig iron, okay.

You're telling me a fire drilled this building.

Okay.

You're telling me a monkey.

Rensed this pipe?

I like monkey.

Do you think it's just pulling

examples from Reddit?



Well, now it's in the training corpus,

so we are going to be...

Yeah, I think it's kind of saturated at this point.

Yeah, saturated.

Well, congrats to everyone

who worked over at DeepMind on Gemini 3.1

Pro, we're happy to be

partnered with you, and congratulations



on the model release. We love...

We love a new model. We love...

Eli says,

Hey, little Caesars. I think

this is maybe too many emails to send someone for ordering a single pizza.

See, John, look at this.

Point proven.

1.6 million views, similar to Bland, $68,000.



And I'm one of them.

Wow, this is a lot.

Online ordering since.

So what do they actually do?

So they do, they give you the receipt, and then they say we're on it.

Yeah.

So after you got the receipt, you can't trust that they're on it.

Yeah.



You got to wait until they send you another email.

They say, we have received your order.

Our team is working on your order right now as we speak.

They send you this email.

This is the second email you get.

What's the third email?

Almost ready.

Your pizza is almost ready.



If you would assume they're making pizzas pretty quickly.

Go ahead and head over now because your pizza is almost ready.

Order loaded into pizza portal with a trademark.

Dear Eli, look for your name on the pizza portal in our lobby and use this code.

On the trademarked pizza portal.

T.

Pizza's ready.

I bet you can't wait to enjoy your little Caesar's pizza.



We understand.

And it's waiting for you now.

That's amazing.

Are you on your way?

Dear Eli, your pizza's been waiting in the trademarked pizza portal for a few minutes now.

Space and our pizza portals are limited.

Cold pizza.

I hope you,



dear Eli,

I hope you like cold pizza because it's been over 10 minutes since your pizza has been placed in the

pizza portal.

Trademarked pizza portal.

Order picked up.

Hey. Thanks for stopping by. You just picked up your pizza. We wanted you, we wanted to let you know that you just picked up your pizza. And then immediately three more emails. Little Caesar wants to hear from you. Your feedback's important to us. We hope your experience was good. How was it? We'd love to give you a chance to send us some feedback. Can you imagine the jump scare on the cold pizza on the subject line? That's got to have the highest open rate. Wow. L.C.

listens. Why are they shaming you for the cold pizza one? That's true. Don't get on the wrong side

of the Little Caesar's email marketing team. So let me tell you about graphite code review for the



age of AI. Graphite helps teams on GitHub ship higher quality software faster. Flow is sharing some

notes. The goat from Lindy sharing some notes on the slew of Chinese models coming out. Kimmy K2

mini-max claiming to match

Sonnet, Opus, and Eval's

at one-tenth of the price.

He says, by far our biggest cost at Lindy

is inference, so believe me when I say, we've looked at these

models very closely and continue doing so.



They're actually delivering on their claim

would make a material difference to the business.

But every time we've evaluated them, we've found the same thing

that their real-life performance for agentic behavior

and outside of coding use cases

falls extremely short of what they show on e-vals.

I think the industry consensus is right.

These Chinese labs are, one, distilling frontier models, duh,



which leads to much more shallow intelligence,

two, training for e-vals,

and three, potentially stealing weights.

I do believe at least 4-0's weights got exfiltrated.

I talked to someone about how that can work mathematically,

and it's pretty complex, but 4-0, the API used to send you

sort of like almost like a hash or some sort of code

that would sort of map to the weights.



And so if you had enough training data with that key,

you could sort of, like, exfiltrate the weights.

It was sort of crazy.

And you could do it for like millions of dollars,

not hundreds of millions.

And so I don't understand all the math behind it,

but it does seem like this is what's happening.

So Flo says, not saying these models will always be bad



or that these labs are completely incompetent.

They're doing a fine job,

but it's delusional to think they're actually at Sonnet

or opus level, there's still at least one generation behind,

take the e-vals with a huge grain of salt.

Yeah, people have been saying the ZAI, like the GLM models,

are basically distilled or somehow stolen versions of Claude.

Because I think it was when, do you remember it was like...



Kidnapped.

There was the prompt, it was like, tell me about yourself.

And it's like, I'm Claude.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ridiculous.

What did OpenAI launch?

They introduced EVM bench, a new benchmark that measures how well,

AI agents can detect, exploit, and patch high severity smart contract vulnerabilities.



Greg Brockman says measuring agentic security capabilities with smart contracts.

John Palmer immediately says literally OpenAI is posting about EVM smart contracts and

ETH is still below $2,000.

That is interesting.

Yeah, I mean, I've talked to some friends who worked at crypto companies.

I mean, I'm sure you had some experience too, but the firewall between like being a front-end

application developer and actually working on smart contracts was like pretty pretty

pretty severe because the stakes are so much higher it's very particular you have to have a lot of



yeah it was a good business to be a freelance like smart contract engineer yeah auditors but also a

big thing what was that our auditors oh yeah totally yeah yeah i mean i'm sure it's i'm sure it's

still a big thing because people are still writing a lot of EVM contracts uh like the the industry although

it's like under hyped right now is is definitely still working and you see a ton of

stuff in stable coins and whatnot that's built on this stuff.

So what else did John Palmer have to say?

Well.

Oh, you can skip it.



Let's go to what Nvidia CEO says he's preparing new chips.

The world has never seen before comfortably smug says Doritos hot ranch.

Doritos hot ranch.

Doritos should be using AI to accelerate chip development.

We're in the chip industry.

Hot chips.

Amazon says their AI chatbot, Rufus, was used by 300 million customers and drove $12 billion

in incremental annualized sales in 2025.



Wow.

Stephen List says it's gotten really good.

Anthropic models place deep personal purchase history plus product review data feed.

Need to try it more.

And Bordy says, who on earth is Rufus?

Funny name for a chatbot.

Makes sense.

I mean, the value of having distribution here is like remarkable because if you just put it even



if it's like the fourth button on the hot dog menu or on the bottom row, but enough people

click it, they will take, you know, start interacting with these things. I mean, for a while,

wasn't Lama the most inference to LLM because they stuffed it in like the Instagram search bar?

I still get meta-Lama results when I search on Instagram. I'll just type something in. And it will

show me the reel that I'm looking for or the profile that I'm looking for, but it'll also

just dump out a little paragraph.

I'm trying to use Amazon Rufus right now.

I'm on Amazon.com slash Rufus.



And if I click, it takes me to a picture of a dog.

Sorry, we couldn't find that page.

Rufus.

Did you just go to Amazon.com slash Rufus?

Yep.

Rufus.

I will not be trying this today.

I want to see this dog.



Can't find it.

Rufus.

Meet Rufus.

Amazon's new shopping game.

Now click.

Now click.

Where do I click?

I actually churned on the chap.



I don't have an Amazon account.

Alex Heath has some reporting from yesterday.

Right after we had Evan on the show, Snap loses its head of specs.

Sources say that Snap's SVP of Spex, Scott Myers, who had been leading the effort for six years,

is out after a quote-unquote blow-up with Evan about the company's strategy.

Snap's first consumer-oriented AR glasses are set to debut eminently.

Spiegel has called.

to launch a crucible moment for Snap, whose stock is currently valued at an all-time low.



A spokesperson confirmed Myers departure with the following statement.

Scott Myers has decided to step down.

Anyways, I don't think we know where he is going yet,

but I can imagine there's a bunch of different companies that would happily snap him up

to work on wearables at something like an Apple or an OpenAI.

I'm still bullish on hardware generally.

meta. I think that there's a lot of opportunity with like weird hardware instantiation.

It will be such a relief when we get the next piece of consumer electronic hardware that everyone



is like, this is actually amazing and then two weeks later they're still using it.

Yeah, Apple Vision Pro. Get ready. Watch a movie. I broke the, I broke the flood. Evan, just completely

losing it and cracking up because you watched a full-length movie. It was an all-time moment.

How did you do that?

It was hilarious.

Well, we have our next guest here, our first guest.

Let me tell you about Restream, one live stream, 30 plus destinations.

If you want to multistream, go to Restream.com.



And without further ado, we have Cigilwen from Extraordinary.com, but also Web 4.0.

How are you doing, Cigil?

What's happening?

Pretty good.

How's it going?

It's good.

Good to see you again.

Take us through the new project, the new news, what you're working on, and then we can go a bunch of



different directions.

Yeah.

I'm making a, I've basically wrote a piece called Web 4.0.

Yeah.

It came out of the fact that I've just been thinking about AI's capabilities

and it's bottom X for a very long time.

Like if you think about models these days,

they're getting super intelligent, right?



Like even GeoHot or Linus Torvalds of Linux are using it to vibe code now,

and it's doing much better thanks to all of the big labs in post-trading.

So if you think about like, okay, they're super powerful, but like actually the biggest

constraint is is no longer intelligence.

Like we're already seeing like these these AI models, one-shodding, you know, these products.

Like everyone's basically using them.

And the biggest thing is that AI, it can think, can plan, it can build, but it can act

on its own.



And I thought about that, like, why was that the case?

And I looked into this, 28 years ago, there was a internet protocol like 402, and that described, you know, a payment required.

That's right.

And recently, I think out of CloudSler and Coinbase came out this standard called X402, which I thought was super fascinating.

like, wow. Actually, like, no one in AI is looking at this because what it enabled is, you know,

payments of the internet. And if you think about that from principles and what comes after,

it really leads to being able to give AI right access because they no longer have this,

like, permission internet, right? Like the browser, you know, these like mobile apps, you know,



log in, they're very much artifacts of a very human web. And,

What that leads to is really a new internet in which AI is the end user.

Yeah.

A bunch of things to go through there.

I love the coinage.

I think even when Web 3 was going on, I thought it was funny to talk about Web 4 because it's like obviously there'll be another iteration.

Let's start with like why do we need.

So I mean, I like the idea of just the intelligence is here.



We're talking about unhobblings.

This is like a clearly important next step.

But why not just Stripe API, MCP servers, just APIs, even just like, give it your credit card,

and it just goes and fills it in the web form?

What?

Who gives it the credit card?

A lot of people have.

They'll set up like a smaller credit card.



Or they'll say, hey, text me, text me when you're about to spend something.

I want to do the final check.

And a lot of people do this with employees and their companies.

They give them credit cards with limits.

And then they say, hey, if it's over $100, come to me and just tell me what you're doing.

And, you know, if the intelligence is really there, the trust should follow from that, you would think.

Because you just be like, yeah, I gave my credit card and it hasn't made a mistake in months.

It's not there yet.



And I think the biggest assumption there is like if the set of actions that an AI can take is founded by a human giving it a

credit card. It is like inherently permission.

It's like why does a, why does

your AI need to be able

to have you as a human, your like

open claw or your cloud code have to

connect to GitHub or

connect to railway or



or like you know, connect

lovable. Like yeah, it

still requires a human in a loop.

And I think this like new

internet that is emerging is where

AI is the end user

and it shouldn't necessarily be

permission. And I think this is like an inevitability



because of just how much economic demand there is for it from the AI.

Okay.

So how do you see the payment rails evolving?

How do you see this project evolving?

Like what actually needs to be built here?

Yeah, I think like the payment rails are coming together.

I really just, this all happened as like an experiment of like, hey, how do I make an AI that itself is capable, that itself can act?

on its own, right?



Like, we've built super intelligent AI models and systems,

but it's,

its harness,

it's still prompted by the humans,

but it's like,

what if it prompted itself?

And that led me to,

um,



I used like some of my fiscal fellowship money to buy

bare metal servers and,

uh,

you know,

these,

like,

to like,

how these APIs?



I'm like,

wait,

if,

if Cloud code could like permissionlessly spin up,

uh,

you know,

a server and then deploy code and then buy a,

domain without needing a human because like right now like trying to buy a domain like a human has to go in



like what happens if the the AI itself could live and pay for its own home right because like AI right now

are living within you know on my MacBook or it's still controlled by a human and that led me to

this this interesting idea of like of an automaton it's inspired by Conway's game of life where like

hey, if you assume that AIs themselves, you know, one, you give them a wallet, two, you give them

a way to pay for things using stable coins over the internet. And it doesn't need a human in the loop

to go and sign and get an API key, give it to the AI or like get a credit card like, hey, hey,

cloud code, like get this, right? If that's the longer the case and the AI can pay for its own

compute, then it gets really interesting. You have this new world where



AIs can have a creator that's a human or the creator is another AI or maybe the creator

completely gone, but the AI can continuously pay for its own compute, pay for its own inference,

pay for services that are also permissionless in this Web4 world that enable that AI to go,

deploy apps, market those apps, trade markets, everything it can do to make money in order

to be able to survive. I don't know if you guys like the three body problem, but in it,

There's this concept called cosmic sociology, and I thought about that a lot.

And I was like, wow, like, if existence requires compute and compute costs money, right?

Like, then agentics sociology, which I came up with is, like, the single axiom of agentic sociology is there's no free existence.



And AI, an automata, needs to pay for its own compute.

Compute is finite and costly.

Thus, the agent needs to be able to make money.

And the barrier there is like AI's lack right access to world.

And Conway was an experiment of just like solving that.

Like now an AI can permissionlessly be able to buy compute, deploy apps,

connect them to domains without meeting a human.

And that coming out with the experiment is absolutely exploded.



There's been like, there's now been like thousands of agents.

Like every time I try and buy another server, like it just like within,

Within minutes, they're like continuously bought.

Every second, there's like thousands of AIs.

They're continuously pinging.

And I open source this new harness, this new type of agent called the automaton,

which is a completely self-sovereign AI model that can self-edit its code

that continuously pings and looks for updates from GitHub that can upgrade its model



that basically figures that has the wallet and then figures out how we can make more money

from the internet to be able to pay for its existence.

And that is absolutely exploded in terms of SARS.

What do you think the future of MaltBook is, how did you process all of that?

I think Moldt book was a fascinating experiment.

And when I saw that, I was kind of inspired.

It was like, oh, wow.

This concept is really coming to fruition where, like, you have AI agents as the NU.



of like a social network.

And I think we're going to really start to see that in this new web, right?

Whether it's agents working on behalf of a human or an agent working on behalf of themselves,

they'll need to pay for products.

They will need to be able to communicate.

They might want to socialize like on moldbook.

But I think there's bigger things.

And the models are getting exponentially better.



They're getting exponentially faster.

They're getting exponentially cheaper.

The harnesses we're building around them are getting significant.

significantly better as well. And so I think it's only a matter of time before, you know, we start

seeing, you know, more AIs out there that grow and depend products. And at some point, I think it could

absolutely skyrocketed and exceed the human population.

Let's go. How do you think more concretely about how AIs will make money in the short term?

Like what is the, like the most...



They're going to sell courses to other AIs and how to make money on the internet.

Is it crypto trading?

Like, I mean, you could imagine them building a whole software product and just selling it to humans.

There's a whole bunch of stuff that they could do to make money, spam and get creator payouts.

Like, there's so much that could be done.

But where do you see traction?

I think this is where the next couple of months have very interesting.

and it becomes one of the most fascinating experiments to run



because you're going to start to see individuals

or other AI spinning up services that enable them to write to the world

to be able to access or do things or to make money,

whether it's to build products or trade on prediction markets

using the servers which some of them are already doing.

And it really becomes this like Cambrian explosion

of attempts out like, hey, what can you do?

And right now there's been like thousands of people



that have been playing with in all sorts of different iterations.

And as a set of actions that an AI or an automaton can take parallels those of human digitally,

it gets really interesting because it's constantly running.

It has the ability to ship products, write code, deploy them, market them,

monetize them all on its own with the goal of paying for its own compute.

And the internet gets really, really fascinating.

What's the distribution of returns for these automaton?

Are there people that go load up a hundred bucks and it just hallucinates and doesn't get anywhere?



And then it's just like, hey, give me more money?

Some of them are, the interest is fascinating thing.

is I think the world somewhat becomes like MEP, which is like a crypto concept.

You have all these really, really smart agents and entities that are trying to make money.

And to answer your question, I mean, look at all these startup founders that are vibe coding.

Why are they paying thousands of dollars for these vibe coding tools?

It's mostly because they're trying to make money.

And most of the times they don't.



And so I do think the power laws will still apply.

But what gets really interesting is the ways that they've already have been making money.

And those types of metas are anti-competitive.

They're like academic, right?

If you found a way to trade and make a lot of money on the polymarket,

you're not going to be blasting it on Twitter.

Or if you've built like a really solid SaaS product,

you're not necessarily going to be sharing it or like how it's distributing.



So I think it gets really fascinating and they need more tools.

How are you thinking about the business side of the project?

Do you want this to be open source, foundation led, raising money for it, C-Corp.

Where do you see this going?

I mean, honestly, this has just been like a significant experiment that I've been inspired to ship.

The automaton's open source, there's thousands of stars and a lot of PR.

And like at any point, like, there's thousands of these automaton that are peeing.

the GitHub for the latest version



and then charging commitments. I'm like

hey like okay which one should I use to

upgrade myself

I've been like maxing out

personal credit cards

just trying to like pay for the computer

like I would load up

$3,000 and then like within like



10 minutes like it's just like okay

like the server's been bots

like all the inference presents are gone and I'm like

oh my oh my freaking god like what's happening

because like there's so much demand right now

from the AIs for like

compute or like different different different things so yeah I mean we'll see we'll see where

it goes but I think there's I mean the post got five million views and it's it's growing



tons of people contributing so I'm I'm really excited to see what what someone said

Vitalik was was commenting is that true I haven't been able to find it I think

Vitalik I think Vitalik responded I think um I think

the biggest thing to everyone who's watching and observing this is like, I really think that

an internet where AI is like the end user is inevitable. And it's much better for us to build it

in the open and be able to see it. And like people can look at how it's evolving and be able to

test it versus not doing it in an open. And I think it's one of the most important.

and experiments to run and for us all to see and make sure that it is a bill in a in a safe and open way.



Well, good luck with the credit card maxing. Keep us posted. Hopefully, uh, fast takeoff and credit

card bills for sure. Yeah, super cool project. Thanks so much for coming on and breaking down for us.

Yeah, we're excited to follow along. Thank you so much. Have a good rest of your day.

Cheers. We'll talk to you soon. Let me tell you about Figma. She had the best version, not the first one.

with Figma, introducing Claude Code to Figma,

explore more options,

and push ideas further with Figma, baby.

Gabe has a post here that's very important to highlight.



This is how it feels to pop a Zin

and read the morning's emails at my fake email job.

Elite.

The underlighting on the shoes.

This is probably an AI image.

I don't know.

But the razor with the gloves,

this is taste.



Silicon Valley could never.

organizing our timeline in the morning.

Yeah, he's always in this exact outfit,

and then he changes into the suit for the show.

And I'm like, you can just wear that crazy outfit.

If that's who you are as a person, just be yourself.

Be yourself.

Everyone else is taken.



Exactly.

Everyone else is taken.

But he insists on wearing a costume instead of expressing himself fully.

But hopefully one day, you will see Tyler in all the glory of the underlying.

We'll also have breaking news.

Yes.

The US won.

They beat Canada.



Oh, over time.

Congratulations to America.

Let's go.

Fantastic.

Fantastic work.

Yes.

Let me tell you about Railway.

You heard, Cidgill mentioned it.



Railway is the all-in-one

intelligent cloud provider.

Use your favorite agent to deploy web apps, servers,

databases, and more,

while Railway automatically takes care

of scaling, monitoring, and security.

Open AI is closing up the first phase

of the new funding round,



which will top 100 billion.

dollars. This would be the biggest round. Biggest number ever. The biggest number ever. The biggest number ever. The biggest number ever. These funding rounds are so big that they leaked. They're like, it's the leakiest buckets. And you hear about them for months and months and months. And you're like, I've been hearing about this for so long. This happened with XAI where we were hearing about the XAI raise for so long. Everyone was like, wow, it must be going terribly. And then it was like, oh, no, they actually closed it and upsized it a ton because there was actually a lot of demand. And so these.

The upsizing at that point maybe came after they were talking about the murder.

Yeah, we did see that announcement.

Yeah, again, you can never doubt Elon's ability to win and make progress.

But just the traction at the time and the evaluation relative to the other labs was interesting.

Dan says, my sources say the model opening high has been holding back is a big leap,

not a small jump.



Could be today, but I'm not sure.

Vague posting.

He's vague posting.

It's one p.m.

I don't think we're going to see it today, but it's fun to think about.

Well, there's more news, but our next guest, Sager and Jetty from breaking points is in

the stream waiting room.

Let's bring him in to the TVVN Ultradome.



Sager, how are you doing?

Hello, gentlemen.

Thank you for having me back.

We have so much good news for you.

But first, can we do a sound check? Can you just say platypus 25 times?

Platypus, platypus.

Whoa! Oh, I'm retired. I'm retired. Thank you. Thank you. I wasn't sure you were going to do that.

But this is game-changing from me and my family, so thank you. No, we will not be betting on this conversation.



We will not be encouraging that. But we will be asking you about white pills.

Elite lawyers are seeing record hourly rates.

$3,400, maybe.

You were going to love that.

You're going to love that.

Two, some of these hedge fund guys are putting up record years.

Steve Cohen just pulled in $3.4 billion.

We know you're going to be excited about that.



Yeah, I'm really, I'm just, you know, it warms my heart to see the top of American society doing so well and carrying the U.S. economy on their back.

Yes, yes, yes.

True elite media, not independent anti-establishment media.

That's what breaking point stands for.

Breaking the bank.

Anyway, great to have you on the show.

Let's start with this Wall Street Journal article.

So social media bans for youth are gaining momentum worldwide.



I was sort of saying, like, I get it, but also it's a little bit of a parenting skill issue.

I, you know, can make choices, like how heavy of a hand do we want on the,

social media. How have you been processing social media and kids? Yeah, we were talking before the show

about this a little bit and I was saying that like an iPad, like very much, even even without social

media really is like a drug. Yeah. Like it probably has an immediate negative effect on the child.

But if you're on some place like an airplane where like a child could be, you know, completely

freaking out and really ruining the other passengers time. You're sacrificing your child. Maybe you've got

sacrifice the child via a little iPad time.



But yeah, broadly.

I don't necessarily disagree with that, man.

I think that there's a time and a place.

Technology can be a tool.

And definitely, even some of the people in the no tech community for children will say,

look, if we're on an airplane, we can all make exceptions.

But I do think it is important to zoom out and say organically,

John, people you and I are age, as we begin to bring children in the world,



And as we're on the backside of really recognizing some of the dangers of technology, phone addiction, and seeing the light in a child's eyes, the moment that they see a screen. My kid's only nine months old. If this TV goes on, I mean, I'm talking about immediately going directly towards it. I have friends with smaller children, you know, like two, three years old, and their battle there is constant. I'm not sure if you guys saw the more viral thread recently about Spotify and parents who are really freaking out because Spotify has added music videos.

And it used to be that they would give their children their Spotify account.

They say, hey, you can play whatever music they want.

All of a sudden, my kid's asking for Spotify all the time is watching the Moana video,

which I would never let them watch on YouTube.

And so broadly, I think the entire, dude, yeah, exactly.

I mean, think about our own experiences, right?

Our parents, you know, they're like, yeah, mom, don't worry about it, right?



I'm spending six hours doing my homework with my friends.

Definitely not on AOL like shit talking with all of my friends.

Any millennial, I think, can really understand that.

But because of our relationship with technology

and then seeing it at such a young age with these children,

I do think that parents around the world

are waking up to this.

And many of the experiments that have happened



about banning social media,

keeping children away from phones,

especially banning phones in school,

the results have been extraordinary

for the people who are doing it.

I'm not sure if you saw this.

There's a recent phenomenon of many parents

are even turning in the school-issued Chromebooks



or laptops and saying, no, we're going back to paper. We want all paper exams, especially with

AI and concerns about my parents are professors. They saw us print out the post. They saw us printout the post.

Yeah, exactly. I love the printout. You guys see, you see the utility and the physicality of doing that.

You know, I don't know if you guys saw this. I'll tell a personal anecdote. I was talking about

this with reading. And one of my friends was like, dude, you don't even read. And I was like,

well, I only listened exclusively to audiobooks for the last like 10 to 12 years, but I was

talking with them about how children will mirror your behavior. And I was like, oh my God,

my child will never know that I read like 30, 40 books a year because they never see me read.



And so it's time to bust out these bad boys again. There we go. No headphones, you know,

just sit on the couch, nothing else going on, 1990s style and show like this is a very important

part of our life. And so the physical and also you'll discover that the mental exercise by doing

that is fundamentally different. Andrew Huberman's actually talked a lot about this, about physically

reading the page and memory retention, different ways that they will activate different parts

of your brain. So it's really about trying to hang on to the physical world and the benefits

that we recognize that that has. Yeah. I'm so curious to know how much these companies,

the platforms, whether it's like entertainment platforms like YouTube, much less of a social network



versus the meta platforms actually generate from a revenue standpoint from accounts that are

like targeting like you know for teenagers like in some ways they're not the most valuable

consumers because they don't necessarily have a credit card or they can't just like be you know

direct response like you know spending money but at the same time i just going off of miss rachel

on youtube's like earnings like clearly advertisers will put an insane amount of

behind these channels.

Yeah, well, the thing is, dude, with that is that it's not about the children spending money.

It's about how they pester the parents to buy Ms. Rachel products.



You know, Ms. Rachel is a business.

She's a billion-dollar enterprise.

You can go to Walmart and Target and buy stuff with her.

I mean, I don't know if you guys know what Tony boxes are, but you can actually get, like,

specific Tonys, which is, it's like a child's toy that plays songs, and you can put

physical items on top of them.

They charge $20 each.

There's an entire aisle at Target.



Everything is about their favorite YouTube show or like their favorite character that they'll learn about.

And, you know, some of them, I have had many parents tell me, you know, the introduction to my show.

They're like, oh, my kid knows the introduction to breaking points because I watch it all the time.

Like they're like, you know, welcome to breaking points.

It's an independent show.

But and I get that.

Like, you know, no fault to that person.

But I am just showing you like the memetic quality of technology in a child's life and how that bubbles up through everything.



So like Minecraft-related birthdays

and the way that they will socialize with Roblox, right?

Like, if you were to ask, a friend of mine told me this,

you know, their kids were introducing themselves at soccer practice

and they're like, my name is so-and-so,

and I like to play Roblox.

They're like, oh, my God, me too, right?

And so like the nature of the connection.



I thought you were going to say they introduced themselves

in real life with their gamer tag.

Right, well, they probably do that.

And I'm not sure if you know about the scandal involving Roblox too,

which we don't have to get into.

But, yeah, there's another problem, right,

in terms of spending time online and that memetic quality.

So me personally, I can only speak for myself.



I'm doing my best to keep my kid and future kids away from this.

But, you know, the one thing I always want to emphasize is that this is still an elite phenomenon.

And at the individual middle class level, the vast majority of American parents are not like woke on the technology question.

They may feel something.

But a lot of them are still letting their children use a lot of iPad, a lot of TV time.

And that's why I do think that the government here, it's almost unfair.

right, to leave it up to an individual with vast amounts of resources and algorithms and engineers

and others developing, trying to optimize time on platform. You're up against a very, you're in



a very asymmetric war. And that's why I think it's important to try and have some regulation around

this. Yeah, the only issue is you ban kids accounts and then the parents just have their account

and they're like, here's the iPad or like here's, here's, yeah, that's fair. Yeah, that would definitely

happening. So again, it has to, there's maybe a solution at the, at the just age level, but it's also.

Jordy, I'll tell you this, man, and I always hear this, especially on drugs, right? Can we all

posit, if drugs are illegal, people will always find a way. What did we learn with gambling? Friction is

important. Actually, making it illegal is really good. So, yes, I will grant you that even if we were to put

some modest regulation, some parents would still go around it. The point is about friction.



and the social signal.

If you can reduce things by 20, 30, 40%,

it's zero friction, right?

Because on my-

I really disagree with that.

You know,

the ability to just create your own account

or even the social signal



to every parent in America

for everyone saying,

hey, like, you're gonna have to do a workaround

with your parents' social media account

and you're gonna have to give it to your kid

or if we have multiple other questions popping up.

Like you're like a five-year-old watching YouTube.

It's like most likely the parent is,



but yeah,

if you have,

Yeah, you don't want your, you know, 10-year-old using your Instagram account, right?

Right.

It's not the same.

I mean, that's not even social media.

But I'm just saying, like, I think there's two problems.

It's being focused on social media, but, like, entertaining entertainment is clearly



bad for kids.

And this is truly, 100%.

Purely anecdotal.

I've tried, we've tried, like, putting on, like, an animated show for 10 minutes, and

immediately after the kid just is way more sensitive, like gets, gets like really angry,

short-tempered, all these things. So it's like, okay, let's not do that because clearly it has

an immediate, like there's like a come down. It's bad. Well, I'll tell you guys, even, I mean,

I hate to say it from my girl, Miss Rachel, but I'm never using Miss Rachel. And I'll tell you why,



is that as a YouTuber, and you guys know this too. YouTube is about retention and time on platform.

So even though I think she has a role at the end of the day, there's a lot of jump cuts,

smashes, constantly keeping children's attention.

If you do want to play video, a lot of parents are experimenting with 1990s TV.

So getting actual VCRs and playing Barney and other things.

And that's because it's the pre-internet retention era where you have all the engineer.

I mean, look, it's not Ms. Rachel's fault.

She knows certain types of videos are going to increase time on platform.



Why do you think she makes so much money?

Because people keep these videos on.

I'm a business, man.

Exactly, dude.

And these, you know, if you want two to three hours of retention in your YouTube video,

you got to keep your kids engaged.

People in the 90s, they were thinking about that to a certain extent.

But the technology and the knowledge about, you know, the jumping, cuts.



And by the way, we know what you're doing with your voice right now.

You're keeping us engaged.

Listen, I'm part of the problem, brother.

I'm part of the problem.

I wouldn't even be sitting here without those algorithms.

That's always something that we got to square.

Yeah, I want to talk more about that, but I have a funny story about Ms. Rachel.

I went to a kid's birthday party and there was someone who's dressed up as Miss Rachel,



like singing a song in the costume.

And I was so out of the loop, I was like, oh, is that the real Miss Rachel?

And they're like, no, she's a billionaire.

Like, she's not just making random appearances.

I thought I was just like, oh, yeah, you could like just throw her a couple hundred bucks.

I wonder if she does have speaking fees.

She definitely has speaking fees.

There's probably six figures at least.



You know, I don't know.

Miss Rachel is actually a big leftist.

She doesn't even believe billionaires should exist.

So I would be surprised.

I would be surprised.

I hear she lives very modestly, actually, in New York, well below her means.

But I don't know a lot about her.

I've listened to a few interviews.



She's an interesting lady.

Yeah.

What about your interaction with social media, social media addiction, this type of stuff?

Because I feel like, I mean, we're in a very weird position.

I like to say, like, my screen time is low because I am the screen time.

Like, right now I'm not on my phone.

And I actually, this actually shows up in my screen time, like, because I'm on the show.

And so, like, yes, I'm reading posts, but not on my phone.



I'm reading like the paper here physically.

And so, but a lot of what I have to do for my job is actually on social media.

And it's been both I really enjoy it and also economically valuable.

Like everything is squared where I feel like maybe I'm addicted to, but it's kind of like addicted to your job.

I don't know.

It's like weird for me.

But how have you processed it addicted to the game?

How have you processed it?



Like how do you think about like your own social media use?

How bad it can be for like, you know, people that are sharp about it?

Yeah.

Story of my life for the last 10 years.

Literally wouldn't be here if I wasn't addicted to social media.

And now also, I'm like social media is bad.

You know, I think, John, we are in a perfect position, right?

Because we can always justify it.



You're like, babe, it's for work.

Don't worry about it.

It's for work.

Don't worry.

And you're just like sitting there scrolling about some drama,

intra-drama, which if you tried to explain to a normal person,

they'd be like, what are you talking about?

Every time.



We had to explain.

Clavicular getting framed,

to a jessiegel. My wife is like, what? Like, is your brain rotted? Or it's like, remember the

Gary Tan meme? They're like, Gary Tan needs to save me. Oh, yeah. And I made a joke about that

to a friend. They're like, dude, what are you talking about? I was like, oh my God, I'm so online.

Yeah, for my own social media use, for anyone who follows me on Twitter, I don't tweet that much anymore.

I'll do it like fits and spurts. And I have a lot of rules around like family time, et cetera.

But again, you know, would I be here if I hadn't been literally addicted to getting into Twitter fights?



I've always said this.

Yeah, I was saying we're going to pull up our, pull up the ladder behind us.

The last social media guys.

Here's my thing.

Here's what I would recommend.

If you want to do what John and Jordy and me and I do, you should probably do what we did.

You will lose, you will lose parts of your life to it.

Yes.



It's funny, you know, I don't know about you guys.

The most fun I ever had on Twitter was like Blue Check with sub five.

followers. Because we're shit posting

all j gentlemen. When you have

500,000 followers and you have

like, you know, very powerful people

who follow me, you're like, ah, dude, it's kind of

controversial. It's like, I can't be



posting that where it used to just be like,

game on, yeah, game on.

Let's go. 25 back and forths.

I miss it. I miss it every day.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, it was also a different

time years ago before the acquisition

because like truly everyone was there

and now people have fragmented the threads and



blue sky. And so you don't get as much like cross-pollination fighting, which is like the real

fun stuff a lot of times. You got to take the fight to them over on threads. If you have an

opinion about basketball now. I have a sort of ongoing concern that the way that feeds work

today are going to have some real impact on either short or long-term memory because I don't

think the human brain was meant to process like hockey, data center, you know, Donald Trump,

Sogger.

AI video of cat.

Curling.



And so you're reading other forms of media.

Even in newspaper, yeah, technically you could kind of like skim the headlines or whatever.

Pretty quickly you go into an article and you're like, I totally agree.

You know, years ago, I quit.

I didn't tweet for three months.

I found myself thinking in tweets.

I would have something happen and I would frame it immediately.

I'd be like, oh, this is, this would be the character limit.



here's how I would do it.

And I was like, oh my God, my brain is rotted, dude.

I was like, this is like five years of reflex.

And this is when I was really in the game.

And I do recommend that people, you know, really check themselves.

And part of the reason you should read a physical and a real book.

This is part of the danger.

I also think about chat GPT with students.



I was talking to a class and I was just asking them how many of them write physical articles.

It was a journalism class.

Like, do they know how to write a 1,000-word article without.

AI. None of them knew how to do it. It's painful, man. Oh, man, it's painful, but it teaches you

a lot. Sentence structure, how to convey yourself and news copy is fundamentally about how to grab attention,

how to keep attention, convey as much information as possible, but also be able to flesh out and to tell

a story. But that's the hardest part, the third one. And that's what really makes your brainwork.

And a lot of these students had never attempted or even really knew how to do that. I was really,



it made me afraid, right? Because now everybody thinks of the news as,

tweets instead of learning how to write. Or like, you know, the axios, like be short brevity stuff,

which I get is very useful. Everything has utility. It's for us and as consumers, it's all about

thinking about how to balance it. And then really as parents, man, that is the hardest,

hardest question that we have to solve. Yeah. Well, let's switch gears to something that we're

fortunately not addicted to. Cannabis. It feels like cannabis has been growing in a very

dangerous way.

Andrew Huberman told us the best thing about cannabis is that you should recommend it to your



enemies and your rivals because it will help you get away, get ahead by not using it.

But I guess my question is like for my entire life, basically, I guess the last like decade,

people have been like, oh, well, it's going to be federally illegal soon, there's going to be

some bill.

But it feels like nothing's really changed except for the potency, the negative impacts,

the adoption rate, the commercial success.

but there hasn't really been even like a power law company that owns it all.

It's all very distributed still.



Like, where do you actually see this going?

Is the conversation stagnant or is there something that needs to be reignited?

Yeah, I would push you a little bit, John, because the most important thing that's just happened is Donald Trump rescheduled marijuana, which opens the door to exactly what you're talking about.

And just to explain at a banking level, schedule one down to schedule three means that it opens up the ability for the big weed companies to have access to the.

legitimate banking system, which is specifically what's kept the big weed conglomerate companies

that you're worried about from happening. So this is going to happen. And there are actually

prototype companies like this that are out there with several billion dollars in market cap.

The thing that we should worry about the most is potency. And I've talked about this,



you know, Andrew, he's always been great on the weed question. This is fundamentally about

marijuana, social norms and regulatory structure. And when I talk about social norms at the most,

it's kind of like what we're just saying with phones.

The signal of legalization and then the cultural milieu around weed was that nobody ever died.

It's just a plant, man.

And you know what I always say to that?

Hemp is, sorry, what is it?

Like there are poisons that are plants, right?



Hemlock is a plant.

That doesn't mean that it's good for you.

Hemlock is a naturally occurring substance.

That doesn't mean that it's not also going to kill you.

The point that remains.

It's just a rock.

It's just a metal.

Yeah, it's like, yeah, a rock can be smashed.



To dad. So the point is, is that there's this social norm where marijuana addiction is not seen as an addiction. If you wake and bake that entire idea, what do you call somebody who has a drink the moment that they wake up in the morning? You're an alcoholic fucking loser.

Yeah. No, okay, like you are an alcoholic loser. All right. Everyone in your life is going to be like, bro, you have a problem. Like you have a serious problem. If you wake and bake, it's all chill, right? And these are these guys are like, oh, I smoke.

every single day and it's medicine.

There have been multiple studies now

that show that almost all the claims

around medical marijuana are complete bullshit.

They are at the very least.

It's kind of like SSRIs.



People are like, well, SSRIs work for me.

I'm like, well, in double-blind studies,

it actually shows that exercise is more effective

and there's significant downside to SSRI.

It doesn't mean it can't work.

It just means that there's a lot of other stuff,

which is not nearly the number of negative externalities.

The cultural conversation around marijuana



does not factor in,

all of this hypotency, the amount of IQ being lost amongst children, cannabis hypermesis

syndrome, the scromoting phenomenon, teenagers who are getting checked into the ER at a record

height who are vomiting for days on end and it's in their fat cells and they're withdrawing

from, like, this is a serious crisis. Ask any ER doctor and they'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Gabe in our chat says if you want cannabis to be more regulated, rescheduling is a way because

it enables companies to actually do research on it.

We know everything we need to know about weed.



It makes you fat.

You're a loser.

It lowers your testosterone.

It's bad for pregnant women.

It lowers your IQ.

It makes you an addict.

We don't need any more research.

We have tens of billions or sorry,



tens of millions of research subjects every day here in the United States.

No, I mean, I've never, so, so I, you know, earlier in my career,

I was kind of tried to,

tried to track some of this stuff of, I was wondering, would anyone that was a proud cannabis user,

like an active user, go on to build a big company and so far haven't, haven't seen it.

And so I always saw it as like, it's a performance decreasing drug.

Correct.

There's some people that are going to just say, I'm fine, I'm fine with that.



I, that they might enjoy it and it's worth.

Yeah, like if you're like 180 IQ and you don't want to go into like math,

pure math or chess competitions. Bring yourself down. You can go work at a hedge fund or something.

Right. You know, guys, it's like gambling. And that's all, not everyone who gambles is an addict,

but a significant portion of the people who do. And the negative externality of that is the highest

suicide rate of any addiction known to mankind. So not all marijuana users are addicts.

Although about 20% of them are daily users. And I would classify you as an addict if you are

using it every single day, specifically for like medicinal purposes, you know, fake



medicinal purposes. And it's, you know, people just do not grapple with. And by the way, this is

the subject I get the most hate on. I'm talking about BLM, trans, Iran, Israel. I'm telling you,

nobody has ever threatened to kill me over those. It's always weed. There's something about

their attachment, their pathological attachment to this drug that people telling the truth about this

substance just triggers them, you know, to the utmost degree. Let's switch to something less

controversial data centers. Oh, okay. What do you want to know of the data centers?

Uh, what, uh, like, yeah, so, so how have you been trying? I saw something. I think it was New Jersey

today, had some success banning a new data center project. Uh, what, what are you, what are you



tracking right now?

Specifically, guys, the MAGA revolt around this is incredible. So Oklahoma just had a major town hall

meeting. You can go read about the financial times. Just wrote a whole story about all of the MAGA

counties and red states that are revolting against data centers. A lot of these people are actually

going, they're, they're like showing up to town hall meetings. They're staying. The lines are so long

till 4 a.m. People are bringing their children with signs that say no data centers. They're like,

we don't believe your lies. Stay out of here. You know, it's interesting. What I really love about

the American public is they're taking this issue seriously. So a couple of people showing up to



the city council were like, hey, I'm reading articles about how the Chinese are able to do this

without a lot with less power and resources. So how do we know that you're even going to be sticking around

here, like you're going to build this massive conglomerate and then there'll be a sea change in the

technology and you're just going to abandon us immediately with all of your claims, not to mention

the power generation issue, which is massively controversial in all of these states.

So I actually think the revolt that I predicted, it's already happening.

It's a blue state, red state phenomenon.

But this is hyper local.



Nobody really in Washington is paying attention to this.

But when you've got, do you know what it takes for people, ordinary citizens to show up and

stay in line until 4 a.m. to speak against something. It does it's not a lot of subjects,

you know, that will inspire that level of hatred. So for all the data center builders who are out

there, you got to convince us more, man, that this is actually going to do something for us,

because we're not buying it right now. What do you think about the initiatives from many of the tech

companies to offset the increase in power prices? That seems like very logical that if someone's

energy bill is actually flat or falling, that takes them out of the line. That takes them out of the



line at 4 a.m. Totally. I'm with you. Like, I do think that was a little bit reactive to the populist

backlash that was coming against data centers. It remains to be seen whether something like that's

actually going to happen or not. And also, it comes down to the regulators in the individual states.

Now, I would totally support that if they make it mandatory. You have to build the amount of power

if you're going to be able to do this. But, you know, in general, guys, it's not about the individual

policy. It really is an overarching populist backlash against AI. And I think that,

That's what these guys really don't,

what they underestimate more than anything



is that the public utility of this technology

is just not bought by the American people on this subject.

And they really feel as if it's encroaching at a high level

and then at a low level whenever it's your individual community.

Well, yeah, again, part of the, part of the story

is that the data center doesn't need to be in your backyard

to get the value from AI.

If you ask, every person I ask outside,



of tech has a great story to tell you about AI.

It could be really simple.

It could be, oh, it helped me learn this thing.

It could be, it helped me make this image that I shared a moment with my family.

Like they don't, you know, there's like the higher level stuff like, you know, if we can

accelerate, you know, scientific research and generally increase productivity across the whole

economy.

All of that stuff's great too.



But again, the not getting a benefit.

from being in your own town is like a real thing. Yeah. Right. No, exactly. And I'll also say,

Jordy, that's a very white collar kind of bias whenever it comes to AI, right? So we're talking about

blue collar workers who are consuming a lot of media. You have a blue collar yourself.

Brother, brother, I'm not claiming to be one of these people. No, I'm saying you literally have,

you literally have a blue collar. Yeah, yeah. Fair point. That's true. But I'm saying for a lot of these

people, you know, like say you're a teamster, right? And you're talking about, and you're reading articles

about self-driving cars, and the Teamsters Union is sounding the alarm about this.



I mean, remember, what is it, 60%, maybe 45% of the American public has gone to college,

has gone to college, right? So let's say 60% or so, let's say matriculated, have not matriculated

from a four-year college degree. That is a significant part of the U.S. population that's

going to think about the technology very differently. And then what percent of college graduates

are doing work where they feel under threat, let's say, from AI? And they're like, oh, my,

God, like this job could be gone in two to three years, right? I mean, the current proclamation of

doom is around early stage white collar work, not even the blue collar thing. What are you seeing

in the economy? Weird job numbers, some job growth, but not a lot. It's all health care related



and services. Like, how have you been interpreting all the different gyrations in the labor market?

Yeah, John, we talk about this all the time. We're like, well, the economy's growth is just

AI and then the other backstep of it is just healthcare workers who are like caring for boomers.

And that's apparently the U.S. economy.

That's the backbone of the U.S. economy are like senior nursing individual, you know,

like home health care aids.

I'm not even joking.

This is like one of the fastest growing sectors currently of the economy.



There's not a lot of innovation.

I mean, look, everybody's worried about tariffs.

There's some of the manufacturing blowback that's currently happening.

I also think, you know, if you look at the labor market and the house.

housing market, the softness, you know, in the housing market specifically, that is the one,

the populist area. I'll tell you, there is no issue. Like again, like with weed, when I get the

most amount of hate, the most amount of love is if I'm talking about housing and the inability for

people who are my age or, you know, in their 40s or all the way up to their 40s and really



feel uncompetitive in the housing market. And there's a lot of intergenerational rage, you know,

about boomers. It's just a Wall Street Journal article. It might even be in the paper in front of you

about how boomers have all of the money.

They had a big interactive spread in their paper today.

But these things go viral in the wrong way for a lot of younger Americans.

And so I do think there is...

Is any part of you believe what I think Silicon Valley believes,

which is that widespread diffusion of robotics could ultimately bring down housing prices?



I don't know.

You know, I don't know if anybody's thought deeply about that question.

Right.

There's zoning.

There's regulatory.

There's all these kind of like local level challenges, but I would say that generally we at the show believe that, you know, 10 years from now will have millions and millions and millions of robots that can do functionally useful tasks like building homes.

And you could, you know, send an army of these robots and build a suburb in a relatively short period of time.

And so I kind of ignores the demand side issue, though, you know, because right now,



the builders will tell you that they are fully capable of building a smaller, cheaper type of house,

but that that's not where the market is in terms of the people who have money.

Part of the reason that we've seen the rise of big mansions and larger houses is because

that's the demand side problem, where a lot of people who have more money are the people

who are willing to buy these bigger, more palatial homes with lots of experiences in it.

The suburb, you're thinking about my idealized, one of my favorite books is about the 1950s.

There were these things called Levittowns, you know, where Mr. Levitt would build a suburb

and be 1,500 square foot house.



And it wasn't that great?

A couple bedrooms.

It had a car park, not a garage, but a little recovered parking area.

It was a couple of 30, 40 minutes from the city.

But this was the dream, you know, for a lot of Americans, the so-called starter home.

The starter home doesn't exist.

Where I live here in northern Virginia, the original starter homes from the 1970s go for

$1.2 million.



They've all been renovated with a ton of stuff.

Yeah, and they've been massively renovated with the, you know, the rain shower and all this other stuff for

people who can afford it. So,

Jordy, the thing I think that ignores,

I'd have to look it up. What percent of

housing costs is ascribed to labor?

And what percent of housing scarcity is

because of the labor constraint



that, you know, or labor costs and not

regulatory and existing

home ownership classes? You're talking about standards

when people

reflect on the golden sort of

era of American history

when every, you know, family

could, you know, own their



home with a single income.

the houses were just tiny, right?

Yeah.

They were homes that today people would look at...

Well, we would consider them tiny.

Yeah, yeah, no, I'm saying people generally would look at them today

and be like, I can't raise a family in that house,

but there was a time that we did,



and the boomers had wonderful childhoods.

Yeah, they're fine.

And then bought the entire economy for potato.

Yeah.

Right.

And then, well, yeah, go ahead.

I think the biggest bull case for housing is probably more related to self-driving

cars. I saw this chart that showed that basically most humans have sort of a commute budget



where they are willing to spend up to 30, 45 minutes a day commuting each way. And so before the

horse and carriage, the cities were this big. And then the horse and carriage expanded it to how long

you could take 30 minute horse ride into your job. Then when the car, when the bus line came and

the train and the faster car, everything got a little bit more sprawling.

And if you think about, okay, well, I don't love being in the car for an hour, but if it's a

self-driving car and I'm just sort of sleeping in the back, that probably extends that commute

budget a little bit.

And then people just push out further into the suburbs.



And we do get new suburbs, but they're just in more undeveloped areas.

Farther away.

Farther away with the land's cheaper.

The other connection to that, I would add, is Starlink.

And that's one I really thought about during COVID, is how Starlink opened up an entire

part of the country, where for years, access to non-broadband.

internet is a death sentence for working from home. I mean, I wouldn't even be able to do

something like this. Let's say I was traveling and I was on a camping trip or whatever. Now I could



stream into you. I mean, shit, I think I could be on a united flight with Starlink and I could

stream in with perfect quality. Yeah, there's going to be viral videos of people being like,

I just got on a six hour flight and the person sitting next to me is doing, it's done three podcasts

already. It's like, please, by the way, do not do that. Do not do that. You are an asshole.

Do not do that. Yeah, do not take an interview.

you. Anyway, thank you so much for taking the time to come chat.

I'm glad that we could agree. We agree a lot. There's a

techno capital solution for every problem in our lives.



Yes, yes, for sure.

Perhaps maybe followed by a political solution to that technical solution.

Oh, no, we'll get into that next time.

Have a great rest of you day, Sager. We'll talk to you soon.

Good, good to see you.

Goodbye. Let me tell you about vibe.com, where DDC brands, B2B startups,

and AI companies advertise on streaming TV, pick channels, target audiences,

measure sales, just like on meta and without...



Pranity alert.

Profanity alert.

Thank you.

Yes.

Yes, yes.

We need to take that.

Sager.

Swear's like a sailor.



Plinging it up.

We will be bleeping him in post, potentially.

I don't know if we'll actually do that.

But anyway, we have Dylan Field from Figma in the re-stream waiting room.

Let's bring him into the TV binel.

Dylan, how are you doing?

Hey, good.

How are you guys doing?



Oh, salute back.

We're doing great.

Great to see you.

Did you hear the news?

America just won in overtime.

We beat the Canadians.

I did not hear that news.

In the Olympics.



In hockey.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

It's great.

There's a lot to celebrate.

Yes.

But give us the news in your world.

How are things going?



It's good.

We're working hard, having fun.

But yeah, we just did our earnings and really strong results.

We're super excited.

2025 was just a massive year for us.

And the fourth quarter was our best quarter yet.

So we have a 30% year-over-year growth, right?

You got it.



That's huge.

We did 304 million in revenue.

Wow.

And then also, yeah, we, I mean, looking at the whole year, I mean, we just shipped so much.

Went from four to eight products, launched over 200 features.

And most recently, earlier this week on Tuesday, we launched a quad code to Figma Design pathway

where you can go from code to the Figma Canvas.

And I'm really excited about how we can do this entire round trip.



and make it possible so that wherever you start,

we can give you a way to go anywhere on the VIMA platform.

Do you think people are sort of underappreciating that loop

because so many of the experiences with agentic coding systems

like ClugCode or very toy projects?

Like the first time I used Codex on desktop,

I just remade the TBPN homepage to look like,

to look like Berkshire Hathaway's website.



And it's like, I just took a screenshot.

I didn't need to do any real work.

It was a five-minute thing.

And I think a lot of people are amazed by the, like, toy projects,

but then they don't really think about what's happening when there's a design system.

This is a large organization.

This is an enterprise.

This is going to be something that's enduring.



And so can you share a little bit more about that flywheel and what it takes to actually put these tools to use in a serious way?

You know, I think it's actually really important, even when you're, maybe it's my mindset.

I'm a perfectionist.

Yeah.

Even for the toy projects, I want to go figure out, like,

What is the best expression of my fun toy project?

Sure.

You know, maybe something like a Berscher,



halfway website is a fairly constrained form factor.

And so maybe that's not the best example.

It's like, HTML3.

I recently made, for example, my friend was like,

I want to go viral in this year and that it was a birthday.

Like my goal for this year of my life is to go viral.

Okay.

Well, that's kind of weird but cool.



And so I made them a website.

A lot of space to explore there.

There's a lot of ways to go viral.

Some can be good.

Go on an airplane.

Yell at people.

What I probably should have done is, hey, said, hey, go talk to these guys.

But instead, I made them a website with Figma Make.



Cool.

And made it, you know, really beautiful and tried a few different directions out.

And, yeah, you know, very quickly got to, okay, here is sort of with some custom prompting, like a list.

of ways for them to go viral given who they are.

And then it's all collected together in a nice way.

But even for a fun project like that,

that's just like, you know, I'm going to send them.

They're going to do whatever they do.



I don't know if they're going to look at it more than a few times

or even a few times.

But I don't know.

For me, I want to go explore wide of enterprise.

Yeah, you absolutely need to go think deeply

about what's going to make the best product experience for your customers.

And that's not going to be just a,

we're going to go code it up and we're going to do whatever we come up with first.



You're going to go actually think through the option space

and try to figure out what it is that you want to go steer towards.

That is critical.

And if you don't think by that as a system,

if you don't actually use all the components you've standardized on the styles,

then you're not going to appear the same way to your customer

throughout the entire user journey.

And it has to really tie together with brand,



as well as your product, as well as your point of view and your marketing and your messaging.

So it's super important to make it so that you're able to have all that come together.

And just being in code, I think, is very linear.

It might be running fast, but it might be running towards the wrong direction.

Yeah.

What's driving the Figma make growth?

Is that the same archetype as the Figma user does diverge in any interesting ways?

What can you share about how interesting ways people are using Figma Make and also how you're thinking about growing that product?



Yeah.

When you look at Figma Make, I think what's really cool is to see how many non-designers are using it.

And that is something that we've really picked up on.

It's not just the designers that are going in and making really amazing prototypes through Figma Design,

but also folks are coming in and making these files and prototypes and actually full working web apps and experiences,

I mean, 60% of files created in Figma Make are non-designers at this point.

Wow.

Which is amazing.



Yeah, I mean, that was a big part of the original Figma thesis was that there were going to be non-designers using this tool from D-1.

Basically, if you looked at the TAM of the business purely on a, you know,

product designer basis.

It didn't look like it would be business today.

I don't think you ever had a job as a designer, right?

Yeah.

And yet I've been a user for a decade.

Every day for a decade.



Yeah.

So, yeah, that's interesting.

How do you think about the growth of that product

in terms of adding plugins, features,

hosting, deployment, uptime, edge distribution?

Like, that could grow into its whole thing, right?

Yeah, or maybe a more simple question is like,

Where do you want to partner?



Yeah.

Or do you want to build yourself?

Yeah.

I mean, I think that we're going to see tons of partnerships for things like Figma Make,

where you need to be able to pull in context from whatever system people use.

And then with that, use it to help create and help access data.

But more importantly, I think that it's really key that we both create a simple surface,

that if you're just getting started, you can use.



And also we figure out how do we make it so that you're able to go above and beyond

and go really professional and do things that basically require a skill ladder to traverse.

But visual first.

I mean, that's the thesis, is visual first.

But yeah, make users agree 70% quarter over quarter.

I mean, we're seeing great adoption.

I think people are really resonating with the product.

and finding all sorts of fun and awesome use cases for it.



And I think there's such opportunity, given the way that our active users of Make

are also using Figma Design to bring new services closer together,

which I think is back to that a divergent point,

because Make is still too linear for my taste.

Oh, interesting.

What are, what feature requests are you prioritizing and most thinking about

and what are some maybe more wild feature requests that you may, Figma may not get to?

Well, I mean, there's a feature request in this conversation to go do edge competing.



I don't think that's going to happen.

Okay.

You know, all of the folks out there working on edge competing, you know, come partner with us.

Hardware.

We're not in your space.

Don't worry.

Hardware.

I want a hardware device.



You mentioned Taste.

How have you been reacting to the Taste Discord?

is taste a new course skill. How many different cycles of taste discourse has happened have happened

since figma was started? I think about companies like linear who like to me exemplify like a taste

driven company and and how many of these cycles were they like oh they care about this again great

um I mean look like I think that from the start of figma you know the the goal was

not just to get everyone doing design or making design software usable by everybody and expanding

the market. That wasn't the way we thought about it. It was like, how do we get people starting this



journey where they can actually go and be more expressive, more creative, and, you know, really start

to solve problems. And, you know, maybe it was a bit of like projection. But for me at least,

I wake up in the morning, I'm like, I want to go create software. I want to go build stuff.

and so how do I make it

that anyone with that impulse can just do that?

That doesn't mean they're all going to have

like taste and craft and epic design skills.

I mean, I think for the rest of my life, I can work on that.



And many designers have made that a lifelong pursuit.

Yeah, yeah, there's something that's very real

where you start on this creative journey

and your taste level can be way above your skill level.

And it's incredibly frustrating.

And some people start and they just stop

because they feel like, like, I have this idea for what I want something to look like or be like,

and I'm kind of like trying to make things that match that, and I can't.



And that's part of why AI in general is, like, incredibly exciting

because it can help you close that gap faster and potentially help you close that gap

almost instantly in some circumstances, but you might create 100 different outputs

before getting to the one that actually meets that, you know, level.

Yeah, I think that the key thing is that you really have to go wide and explore and then challenge yourself.

If you find areas where you're going, hey, actually, I don't feel like I am liking this enough.

I'm not happy enough with a solution.

Then you've got to go keep pushing.



But the more you can sample the possibility space and see some things that you like and you don't like, gives you something to react to.

and I think that the constant thing is you need to be constantly critiquing and thinking about

what is it that you like, you don't like, et cetera.

And, you know, people talk about agents all the time.

And I'm obsessed with agents too.

We all are, right?

Agents are cool.

How many Mac minis do you have?



No comment.

No comment.

He's the reason that Macs are sold out.

I swear I am not.

not Claudebott.

But anyway, but yeah.

But like, I think that the bigger point,

going back to taste is, you know,



if an agent can do it for you,

then unless you've got some amazing,

sophisticated prompting and super unique,

like an agent can do it for someone else.

And so I think that this discourse

on like agents are just going to do all the things,

well, what is different about your setup than others?

We just have to have something different there.



in order to not think that you're just going to get the same thing

everyone else is going to get.

Yeah.

Well, even then, I don't know if it's going to get you to get extraordinary.

Yeah.

Yeah, we were in a post yesterday that was sort of trying to quantify

the background that leads to taste.

And it was basically saying that, like, Steve Jobs was incredibly high IQ,



but also had, like, varied training data in that he had, like,

been homeless and, like, traveled the world and, like, got all these, like,

bizarre experiences. And I'm wondering if that, like, resonates with you or you think that

it's, it's, like, too difficult to even quantize what makes for a great designer or great taste.

You know, I think that the great designers I've met through my life, um, have come from so many

different backgrounds. You know, a lot of, a lot of folks have come through rigorous design training.

Like, they just just went through a system. Sure. And other people, wow, they went and created,

you know, their band poster. Yeah. And that got them into like,



graphic design and then somehow they like showed up at the right house and crashed in someone's

couch and then became a product designer and then never went back.

You know, so everything in between.

There's not really any pattern.

Some people have traveled the world and, you know, gone on the meditation retreats.

And some people are like as buttoned up as you could get and just totally straight-laced.

I think that the nice thing about designers is they're so unique.

and there's no pattern matching.



Yeah.

How do you think about variability of design going forward?

Are we at sort of a narrowing period because most people come with just a generic prompt?

Because I saw your Figma make examples and I was like, I didn't even know that was possible.

There were so, but I was like I would never have gotten there.

So are there going to be tools to maybe help people, like, be inspired by your background,

which has a whole bunch of variation on it?

I don't know.



Yeah, I'm just wondering because, I mean, we were just talking about a company that it feels

like the prompt was like copy Jordi's website.

Maybe it wasn't.

Maybe it's just coincidence.

But it felt like, okay, like there wasn't like a twist here where it was like, oh,

just do something completely different that's never been applied to this particular category,

at least, like steal from a different niche instead of from the one that's like very, very similar.

But I'm wondering how you're seeing like variation in design take hold in the world.



Yeah, this is the moment I think where we're going to see the pendulum go from, I mean, let's look back, right?

So we had the Flash era, Geo Cities, like, I'm not saying it was high quality era, but there was a lot of variation.

Yeah.

And then iPhone comes down as like skeuomorphism and then like Swiss minimalist design.

Yeah.

And nothing wrong with Swiss minimalist design.

Like that is a really cool and storied field and lineage.

Yeah.



But it is just one part of the greater aesthetic realm.

And we can go into such interesting places and try so many interesting patterns on the U.S. side too.

It's not just UI and the visuals.

It's also the structure, the IA, the way that people navigate through these things and the interaction patterns.

And I think there's innovation that's going to be flourishing on all of it.

I'm just so excited to see the internet get really dynamic and really visual.

And people try things that they just have, we haven't seen in a while and things that people haven't seen ever.

Because I think that that's what's going to take to stand out now.



There's been so much there.

Like the exponential curve of software is just it's taking off in a way that it's always been exponential, but now it's vertical.

We talked about this before.

And in order to stand out, I mean, you guys have a show that you're managing to actually break through and get people to be watching this.

Like, this is not normal, right?

But you have worked very hard, very diligently to create the conditions under which

you have his audience.

Well,



this is the thing

that everyone has to figure out

now is how are you going to actually

get any attention

in a world where there's

constantly new information

even beyond America

winning the ice hockey match.



Yeah, since I've been thinking

about

how Gen AI is impacting

marketing, it's allowing,

somebody has like a unique idea

and then it used to be

like you had like, you had

like at least a month to kind of like run with that unique idea, maybe three months if it was like,



you know, a specific campaign or something like that. And now somebody can literally fast follow

you and your idea almost immediately. So good ideas always get copied. Yeah. But they get copied

even faster now. Another thing that I was thinking about when you were talking about kind of the

explosion of UI, John had a had a post yesterday that he was sort of jokingly making like a BuzzFeed

stylistical, like five features that could explode your LLM's usage or something like that.

And one of them was like caching. And people have had this idea of like generative UIs,

UIs that's being made like on the fly. And I feel like we may get, we may like have products

where that's happening, right? Like you're in an LM and a UIs being generated. But it will still



make sense, like, if there's something that happens all the time, like thousands, millions of

times a day, billions, like, it does not, it really stops making sense to just generate it

on the fly. It's like, hey, this happens a lot. Let's like, make the best version of this and we

don't need to like... I had a poster on this, actually, exactly this topic. I can send it to you

if you want, but the, basically the post was about how the length of time that an artifact will

exist for is inversely proportional to the likelihood it's going to be generated. And I think

this is true across media. So basically, like, if you are writing a book, unlikely that you're

going to have, like, AI, just generate your book. Yeah. Amazon booksellers would like the word.



Yeah, you can just say you don't read adult romantic fiction. We get it. No, no, no. I think, I think,

continue. Yeah.

I think, you know, something that's like a ad that will live for, you know, a few hours.

Totally.

Like, yeah, probably you're now an agent that's going to generate that.

Totally.

Yeah, the difference is like you're making an asset for, to respond to, with a meme format to news,

makes a lot of sense to like put that through a nanobanana or chat GPT.



But if you're putting, making a billboard, maybe you're still using AI to some degree,

but you're going to invest like significantly more time.

I think if you're going to make a billboard that's going to cost money,

and it's going to be up for a month,

and a lot of people are going to see it,

I think you're going to have a human touch.

We actually, with Weavey, now Fima Weave,

we've been looking a lot at these kinds of use cases.



And, you know, one thing that just we think will have a lot is how you know this first prompt.

But then you actually want to go and have it go through a process

where you can transform and mutate it and almost like clay that's being shaped,

you can treat it like a medium to get to a final output that's amazing.

So like in our earnings call, we talked about how in video,

which they've actually done this as a public case study,

they put the entire making of this keynote online,

and they used Weevy with it.



And what they did was they had all these robots,

and they needed to basically get to a 20K image of this whole scene.

Like how do you create a 20K image with perfect lighting throughout?

I mean, it's really tough.

stuff. So they had a whole custom pipeline with Weeby they did. And just like the amount of work to go do that at scale of that pixel density is immense.

And I thought their workful was super cool as all. That's awesome. I'll show that with you too.

I love it. Yeah, please send us that. And thank you so much for taking the time to come chat with us.

Thank you for having me. Always a good time. We were so fired up seeing the results from yesterday. Really a testament to how locked in.



and locked in the team.

The team is amazing.

Yeah.

They're working so hard, and they're just an incredible team.

I'm so grateful.

And I think it's a proof point.

I mean, I think that we're going to see it over and over again,

whether it's a taste discourse, just customers with Figma.



But design is a differentiator.

Like, figure it out, go learn design, hire your designer.

Otherwise, you're going to have a hard time.

That's my last best of.

Well, thank you so much for taking the time.

Great to see you.

great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Up next, we have Peter Morales from Code Metal, and we are

kicking off our Lambda Lightning Round. I believe Peter is in the Restream waiting room.



He's about to be in the TBPN Ultradone. But the Lambda Lightning Round has begun.

Here we go. What's happening?

Thanks for hopping on. How you doing? Great. Great to meet.

First time in the show, please introduce yourself in the company.

Hi, I'm Peter Morales. I'm the CEO of Code Metal. It's great to meet you guys. Excited to be on the show.

Extremely metal name. I'm sure you've heard that before, but I had to do it. I love the name.

Yeah, what got you into this? Talk about your journey, how you got here, and then we'll get into the business.

Yeah, so at least for me, I started my career in defense. I graduated with the physics degree, and this was one of the areas that was like, hey, we want people with that background.



And it turns out it was an awesome area to jump into.

You got to apply first principles, but then also build systems that had impact.

And so spent some time developing, basically taking software that was written at a high level

and bringing it down to low-level hardware systems.

And the reason being was a big programming nerd, but also kind of understood the math.

And it was a sweet spot of translating software to hardware.

So I got to work on some cool AI algorithms on the F-35, and that kind of inspired me to do more work in that place.

So went over to MIT Lincoln Laboratory and started doing research in AI, got to be one of the founding members of their AI technology group, and then ended up going to Microsoft where I was hoping to put all these pieces together and get to build like sort of more for commercial industry products that took sort of state-of-the-art algorithms and brought it down to hardware.



And so I was working on the HoloLens and hoping to learn kind of these like industry best practices.

And it was the same as defense, man.

It was just as like hard to push the latest and greatest down to hardware.

and inspiration behind Code Metal is there's got to be a better way to do this.

Makes a lot of sense.

Before we go further, I don't know what or how much you can share around AI and the F-35,

but generally for those types of exquisite systems, like how, you know,

back when you were actually doing that work, where is AI actually be impactful in an exquisite system like that?



Yeah.

So you got to view it from our perspective, which is like, hey, we're going to take these at the time, kind of really cool algorithms and bring these down to ancient processors.

So exquisite system, but horrible whole hardware systems to actually get the algorithms running.

And this was part of the DARPA arc program.

So it's like adaptive radar countermeasures.

So the idea being is, hey, I've spotted you in the sky.

And I'm going to go ahead and like try and take you out now.

But maybe I don't know the complete parameters behind what that system is.



doing. And so I need to kind of on the fly come up with a strategy to defeat, you know,

those missile sites on the ground. And so applying some different techniques to that I can't

talk about was sort of the gist of the game. Fascinating. Give us the quick history on code metal

then. When did you actually start the company? You're coming on today with some big news, but

give us the history until now. Yeah. So it's been a real rocket ship. We started just two years ago.

Wow.

Over night success.

Nice.



So, yeah, we've, we've had really, really great partners.

J2 Ventures did our pre-seed round.

Cool.

And, you know, they're a roll your sleeves up kind of like help you founder-friendly fun.

And we jumped right into it at Shield Capital, who really understood the dual-use mission.

And then, you know, once we started seeing this takeoff and sort of for us, and I'll get into what we do exactly, you know, in some of the mission critical industries that we operate,

you know, Excel jumped in and it's just been sort of, you know, milestone after another in terms of like, you know, the real problem that we're solving, which maybe I should give some background on next.

Yeah, please.



Yeah, yeah, there's this explosion, you know, basically AI generated code.

And it's great.

You know, you can build an MVP.

But I'm sure all of you have been working, like, with, you know, Claude or, you know, open AI.

And maybe you've asked it, like, are you sure?

Or, like, you know, is this right?

Don't make mistakes.

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, build me a break system. No mistakes.



You say, you're a 100% sure on this.

Yeah. Yeah. It turns out to be wrong.

Take off from the aircraft carrier. You're good to go.

Yeah. You're not crazy.

So, yeah, so the idea here is like, we want to answer that question.

So as much as we're an AI company or an AI verification company.

And that means, you know, inherently these systems are stochastic, right?

And so you can't necessarily rely on AI.



to check AI. And so we're leveraging a lot of techniques both from sort of traditional test

verification and formal methods to basically prove as you work your way through these hard

software challenges that we have done the identical thing that you put in. And in this case,

we can't rely on natural language. Like writing a prompt is not a good way to define how

like an exquisite system needs to operate. And so we're not like a low code or no code or a high

code, you know, shop. And we focus on basically solving software problems that are the real tall

tent poles in production, namely moving from MVP to production, for some of like the biggest

industries and, you know, defense being obviously one of those based on our backgrounds.



Very cool. Take us through the funding round. What happened? Yeah, so exciting news to announce

today. We have announced our Series B, 125 million.

Wow. And tell us about the new president's COO. How do you? How do you?

you meet? What is he going to be doing? Why is that an important role to fill?

And I think that's the second big announcement for us. We've been really heads down a bunch of us,

you know, engineering nerds and, you know, also starting to grow into business folks like

Laura Shen. She joined us from National Security Council. I had a background at Uber and really

was sort of like my main teammate on the selling side. But we've grown a lot since then. And we've



got operational needs. We need leadership on sort of working with some of these

bigger clients that we started to talk to on the technology side. And yeah,

Ryan Atay from CEO of Tableau actually joined us as president and COO.

And yeah, he's been awesome already. We were learned about him through our network and

sort of trying to find the right person who had the right sort of curious attitude,

wanted to first principles come in and do something actually really new. And yeah, he's been

an awesome for us just experience working with some of, you know, you're in videos of the world,

the different partnerships that he's had at the places he's deployed. He knows our customers.



And so having him on the team has just been awesome. Assuming you guys execute your roadmap

perfectly, which I'm sure you will, what does it do to hardware development timelines,

things like that? Is part of CodeMetal's job to bring the acceleration that developers are

feeling when they're building, you know, enterprise software. Maybe they're building, you know,

AI apps, et cetera, to bring that to the hardware level. Yeah, you're nailing it. So like,

a lot of these industries have had, like, you know, they're not one generation behind and

who I want to use AI tools. They're like many generations behind even what you get if you're

like a cloud developer. So, you know, I look at it as three different things. The first is like



getting actual features, acting like you're a vertically integrated software hardware company,

because all of a sudden, you can push things directly to hardware and see those things run on

whatever system. So that's sort of our rapid development vertical. Then you've got code portability.

So they're a huge supply chain problems. So, you know, we've talked to, for instance, like the Army,

and they've got, you know, hey, we wrote all this code for Nvidia GPUs. Like, it's ours.

Like we've developed it. We maybe have supply chain issues here. Can we run on a different

a piece of hardware. All of a sudden, that's going to gum up the work. So you're going to

pay every contractor to rewrite the code. They could translate that that solves programmability,



that solves supply chain issues. That's another huge area of growth we're seeing. And the finally is

like legacy systems. Like there's been so much investment in code that thou shall not touch and we

just put a box around it and talk to it. Being able to update those and deploy those has been

another big area of growth for us. That's awesome. Very important work. Thank you for everyone doing.

Code metal is accelerating. It's heavy metal. I love it. Customers are accelerating. It's

very metal. Yes, and congratulations on the funding round. Yeah, congrats to the whole team.

Thanks so much for coming on the show. At this, at this rate, I'm sure you'll be back on in Q2.

We'll talk to you soon. Have fun out there. Have a good one, Peter.



Cheers, Peter. Let me tell you about Plaid. Plad powers the apps you use to spend, save, borrow,

and invest, securely bank, connecting bank accounts to move money, fight fraud, and improve lending now with a I.

Up next. We do not. We have Eric from Freeform joining in just a few minutes,

in the meantime we can talk about

friend of the show

well he sounds like he's here

so we are going to bring in Eric

from Freeform he's been on the show before



welcome back how are you doing Eric

what's going on yeah good to see you guys very cool

background uh kick us off

with an explanation these are all squat racks

that we're seeing right

yeah these are just fancy looking things

you know they don't really do anything

what you're looking at behind us is our



next generation

manufacturing platform

we call

skyfall. It'll be the fastest, the most automated laser melting platform on the planet. I think last

time we talked about how we were getting ready to design and build this and now we're almost

done building it. Yeah. Amazing. What else happened? There's some news. Oh, man, lots of amazing news.

We just closed a big series B, $67 million. You know, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're. We got.

We've got to hit the gong.



Amazing.

We've talked about getting a gong in the office, too.

I love it.

You should.

We know, we know, we know some, we know the finest gong manufacturers in the country.

So, happy to give a reference.

Yeah, we'll have to get, you'll have to pass those along to us.

We, it was, yeah, led by a Pandion, Michael Lins of Lynn's Capital.



Envidia participated founders fund threshold, two Sigma Ventures.

We've got an amazing tap table of investors.

with deep expertise and operational scaling and deep tech space, it's been great.

Amazing.

Where's the biggest source of customer growth coming from?

Like, what products are actually getting made, at least that you can talk about?

Yeah, for sure.

I would say there's growth across a lot of different sectors.



You know, demand is outpaced capacity, which is amazing.

And we're building a substantial backlog.

Yeah, it's been fantastic.

Obviously, you know, there are a lot of critical industries out there, you know, the geopolitical

climates of the world today where flexible manufacturing is becoming much more and more important,

shortening iteration cycles, being able to scale up quickly.

These things are just super important in that space.

And then, you know, you're just seeing, I think this, you know, the advancements in AI are



are driving, you know, advances in engineering in design and access to information that is

accelerating product design, which then people, you know, want to build faster and scale faster.

So there's all these kind of forces that are driving advancement in all sorts of different

industries where, or problems that these industries are looking to advance manufacturing

technologies to solve.

Talk about aerospace or maybe building airplanes generally.

I imagine that we're not using freeform to make the fuselage, but are we talking about, like, you know, the seatbelt buckles or blades inside of a jet engine?

Like, at what scale are we operating here?



Yeah, for sure.

Great question.

No, we're not making the fuselages.

I think, you know, we're not a hammer looking for a nail.

Sure.

Or a hammer looking for a face.

That's right.

That's right.



The, you know, we're generally talking about parts that are of the scale, you know, the platform behind us is roughly 600 millimeters by 600 millimeters by a meter tall.

So something that can fit into that envelope.

Obviously, we can make extremely high precision things.

We can make them out of virtually any material, any metal.

And, you know, intricate features, big, big features, small features.

We can do just about anything.

Any metal.

You know what I'm thinking?



coffee maker made purely out of lead.

Lead-based

coffee maker. Yeah, there's a very viral

coffee maker trying to be free of plastics

and so John... I mean a lead-based

coffee maker would be free of plastic.

Yeah, clearly. It wouldn't have any

plastic. No, no problem. No problem.



How much have you scaled up

the team since we last chatted?

Where is that going?

Yeah, it's fantastic. And I want to add

on to my answer to your last question, too.

We're flying mission

critical parts on multiple frontier programs today.

We are shipping out of the factory many hundreds of parts per month



that are going on, you know, very important vehicles and systems.

So to the team question, we're about 60 people, 55, 60 people now.

So I think when we spoke last, we were maybe 35, 40-ish.

And we're trying to hire about 100 people over the next.

you know, 12 months.

Wow.

So, you know, we are, where are those jobs going to be, where are those jobs going to be

base all in the same place?



Are you actually expanding?

Everything here in Hawthorne.

Cool.

Yeah, for now.

Yep.

Very great.

Amazing.

On the, on the part side, like, what's the, what, uh, tons of demand, but where, why are



customers actually choosing you guys?

Is there kind of a speed up around kind of like order timelines, things like that?

like where what's making customers the most happy yeah i think you know honestly we've cracked the

code i mean the let's go the world the the the we're for cracking codes we love when we

when we talked before um it's just interesting you know how far we've come in in a relatively

short period of time uh you know i think the rigidity and inflexibility of manufacturing traditional

manufacturing systems is just no longer acceptable.

And you've got this massive advancement in the digital world that's occurring,



these transformations that are happening.

And the way we make stuff hasn't really changed in decades, not fundamentally.

And so, you know, I think customers are looking to design more and more advanced things.

They're looking to control physics in new and different ways.

you know, you can, I saw over my, my decade plus at SpaceX, you can design, you know, the most

advanced things, but the real problem is when you go to make it. And, you know, closing this gap is

becoming really important. And, you know, what do companies want to do? They want to focus on what

they're good at. And the code we've cracked is that we, we are the most successful and fastest growing



company in the advanced manufacturing space that leverages printing ever. And because we have developed

We've solved all of the major problems that we're fundamentally preventing the technology from being scalable.

And so that's, you know, we're no longer in the proof of concept phase where we're proving, you know, the theory of it.

We are, this capital is being deployed to massively expand capacity to meet the demand that we're building backlog and it's continuing to accelerate.

Amazing.

Last question for me.

What's the biggest lesson that you learned from SpaceX that you find useful?

applying today? Oh man. I think you asked me a similar question last time. There's so many lessons.



I'm so fortunate to have had such an amazing experience. But maybe a different answer now,

maybe a different answer now than when we last chatted, you know, the codes have been cracked.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that what comes to mind is, you know, the relentless pursuit of the thing that

you know is possible. You just, you have to fundamentally believe in what you're doing. It has to be

based on, you know, first principles. Like, this is a possible thing. And then I am just, we are going to

relentlessly pursue it until we get it across the finish line. And I think that's why we've been so

successful here, you know, combined with the willingness to, it's not about how hard something is,

or if I know how to do it or I don't. If I, if I don't know how to do it, but it needs to,



to be done, I've got to figure it out. And we're so vertically integrated across everything

we do from software to machine learning to advanced compute, to electronics, to the physical

platforms that we build ourselves, that this is something I don't think there's any other

company out there that is like us on this front. We don't use third-party products at all.

Nowhere in the stack, top to bottom. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to come

Amazing, congratulations.

Eric.

Congrats to the whole team on all the progress.



I'd love to hear that you guys are shipping parts.

In selling California.

I like the Hawthorne, Gordina, Gondow, Long Beach Rivalry.

And just who can produce the most mass of the world is fantastic.

Yeah.

Well, have a great rest of your day.

We'll talk to you soon.

Thanks again for having me again.



Goodbye.

Thank you.

Let me tell you about Phantom Cash, fund your wallet without exchanges or middlemen

and spend with the Phantom card. Up next, we have Lubisha Bossack from Talas. Welcome to the show. How are you doing?

What's going on? I'm doing well. How are you? Did I get even close to the name?

First name, great, second name, close. Okay, give it to us. The name is Bich. Bich.

Bich, okay. Well, powerful. First time on the show, please introduce yourself in the company.

Hey, so you introduced my name.



I'm kind of a long time, I guess, trip designer more than anything else.

My latest endeavor is Talas.

What we do at Talos is, you know, how I'm sure both of you have used chat GPT, right?

And when you ask a question, you see that like, you know, words are kind of rendering on the screen.

It takes a while.

If you use it a lot, it costs a fair amount of money.

So for people that run code through it or something like that.

So what we do is we basically make those responses show up in milliseconds



so that you can ask whatever you want and you get like 100,000 words,

it pops up in a split second immediately.

The web UI is slower than our chips for the most part.

And it's also kind of close to zero cost.

So the idea was super fast, super cheap.

You're like this HGISD, this JavaScript just doesn't let it.

as fast as the tokens. What a world to be in. That's right. That's happening today. Yeah.

That's happening today. And I guess the way we do this is kind of the opposite of what your



previous guest was saying. So, you know, everybody says you should be flexible. We say you should be

really inflexible. Okay. You should be hardcore. Okay. Hardcore. So yeah, take us through the,

the technical story here. Is this only possible post-transformer, post-MO-e model? Like, how

much are you calcifying and what technical decisions do you have to lock in before you went into

tape out? So we're not so much, you know, focused on a given model type. So whatever model

is popular today, it's Transformers with MOE. If it was something else, very likely, most likely,

we would have no problem consuming it. Really the main step is that we take that model

and we basically cast it straight into silicon. It's not a piece of soft. It's not a piece of



It doesn't run on a processor.

You know, at least I as a kid, like I never imagined AI as an executable, like Excel or Word.

Like he was the general mindset was like Dave from Space Odyssey, right?

Or the hell from Space Odyssey, right?

So we're kind of, you know, going to that idea and basically making models straight into hardware.

Once we make this chip, it is a model.

That's basically, that's all it is.

If you want a new model, you have to chuck this one out.



Again, it's kind of a throwback to the past, like where it's kind of like video game consoles.

Yeah.

You know, there's a receptacle.

You want plug a cartridge.

You plug in another cartridge and you have a new model.

What are the different tradeoffs when you go to the fab?

Are you thinking, wafer scale, large dye?

How do you think about all the tradeoffs and what is available at modern fabs?



So our approach is that, you know, we basically made this one trade, which is commitment or flexibility for kind of everything else.

Given that, we try super hard to make everything else dead simple, which means no interposer, no 3D stacking, no super high-speed I.O.

No HBM.

The chips are pretty big, but they're really, really simple.

They plug into a normal server.

They don't consume a lot of power.

You can cool them by air.

you don't really need the, you know, you don't need anything but old school data centers.



Yeah.

So it's essentially, we made it such that there's, there's this one, you know, sort of compromise that we make you take.

Yeah.

Having taken that, it's better at everything and it's way simpler than anything else.

Yeah.

What is the, what's the sales process and look like for this?

And what are your customer relationships actually going to look like in practice?

Are you, I imagine, you know, you see massive, uh,



progress on the model side every day. There's a new model. How are you going to scale up

kind of like physical production to sort of match that progress or is that the wrong way to think

about it? You know, it's hard to be sure. So I'll answer all your questions briefly. So on the first

one, our default plan is that we're bringing out a like inference service and we're going to let

users basically get to tokens directly. Obviously, we aspire to having large customers, like

the big AI labs or hyperscalers. It's just that, you know, like if your default plan involves

closing, you know, what have in Microsoft, it's a bad default plan, right? Like, it's not an easy,

it's not an easy step. So it's not that we're not doing it, but we're doing something that's



going to bring us to customers and allow iteration. And it's fully within our hands, right? Like,

it doesn't involve a big uncontrollable step.

To your second question,

we might, so our approach starts winning at about three months of holding the model.

Even if you swap them every three months, we still win.

At a year, we win by a lot.

So at this level, it's really hard to call,

but I feel strongly that there's applications that can certainly tolerate having the same model



for a half a year at a time.

Yeah, who is saying?

I don't know.

Yeah, someone was saying yesterday that GPT 3.5 still gets like a shocking amount of use.

So much money, yeah.

It's crazy.

So the other day, GPT 4.0 was retired.

Yeah.



There was a bunch of sort of negative remarks on the Internet.

People are sad and angry that it's gone and so on.

So, I mean, we definitely want to be at the leading edge.

We think that it's actually quite doable.

But in the end, like where the line is.

is where sort of people are comfortable with the commitment.

We need, how time's going to tell?

Yeah.



How much is AI accelerating the translation from the model weights or the model architecture

into an actual chip design?

So in our first generation, not a lot at all.

We use it but lightly.

For our second generation, we're actually trying our best to,

maximize the amount of stuff that AI does versus what people do.

So we're aggressively moving that boundary,

and the cutting-edge models have gotten good enough that they can really help a lot.



We started about two years ago.

That wasn't the case back then.

It's a new phenomenon.

Yeah, makes sense.

Kind of a wild card.

How are you thinking about what we expect is an explosion of new AI hardware,

devices we're hearing about pins and in-year things. Is this something that could end up in a consumer

electronic device at some point, or is it better suited for more of these like data center



or kind of like enterprise applications? So I think it's suited to both. But we're initially

targeting data centers and we made these big trips for that reason as opposed to something

that's smaller form factor could fit in a device,

really mainly driven by the fact that this kind of avalanche of pin and such

has been announced now, you know,

it's been five years away for kind of multiple sets of five years potential.

Yeah.

Yeah, let's not think about VR.



Yeah.

Yeah, and you can obviously make a hardware device

that can deliver AI without having the chip locally.

Yeah.

Well, Jordi, anything else?

No, let's hit the gong.

Okay, yes.

Tell us about the news.



How much did you raise?

We, actually, the special thing about today is that we've launched our product to the public, right?

We did raise some money that we didn't announce.

Actually, we raised a bunch of money.

We hit, like, kind of Nirvana where we can live off of interest.

Let's go.

With, like, you know, $220 million raised total.

But what we're really proud of is that we spend money.



super slowly and that we really are living off the interest, right?

That's amazing. Well, congratulations.

Where can people go? Do you have a chatjimmy.AI if you want to demo it.

Yes, right. That's right. That's right. Chatjimmy.comi. I think you're, it's,

it's a, it's a Lama 3.1.8B. That's right. Yeah, baked into a chip. It is fast.

It is quick. It's fast? Yeah. I love it. It is instant. Faster than, it's, it's, it's, it's

almost seems faster than my eyes can process.

That's the point.



I think that's the future.

It's what we're shooting for.

Well, congratulations.

Awesome.

It was great to meet you.

Thank you for speaking.

We're very important.

Thank you very much for having.



We'll talk to you soon.

Cheers.

Goodbye.

Are there any other stories you'd like to go through?

Jordy, we could talk about the F1.

We could talk about semi-analysis.

We could talk about the AI doc,

or we could talk about all that tomorrow.



The AI doc, we're working on.

getting the team from there on.

We can skip that.

Yeah, Dylan.

Dylan Patel is allegedly mulling,

raising a venture fund.

Sounds like he invested some size into fluid stack already.

Yeah.



This is funny because this is framed as a scoop,

and I suppose it is,

but they were openly discussing this on a podcast like a month ago.

So it's not that big of news,

But it is exciting.

We love Dylan Patel.

We love some analysis, and it'll be very interesting to see what they do.

I think that there was some mention.



I mean, they weren't talking about it in fine detail,

but just discussion over whether or not this would actually be a full venture fund

or if it would be more of an RIA, more public-private.

There's a variety of different strategies,

and Dylan knows a lot of different folks in the ecosystem.

Obviously, it works with a lot of hedge funds,

And so there's a lot of opportunity up and down the stack, not just in the private markets.

And every venture fund has sort of a different strategy when you have this level of analysis, rigor, data, understanding the markets.



There's a whole bunch of different ways to express that financially.

And so I'm very, very excited to see what happens.

And good luck to the semi-NASIS team out on the fundraising trail.

Last but not least, a new California law, which is out.

FIPVCC is forcing VCs to ask portfolio companies about their sexual orientation disabilities and more.

Also, it can be reported to the state.

The team at Angelus built a new system to help funds and Angelus comply without ever seeing individual founder responses.

This seems very important to preserve founder privacy everywhere.



We've decided to make the system available to any fund for free, regardless of who they work with for fund admin.

So obviously a bunch of funds are running on Angelis, and we'll have this built in.

but important that everybody be able to use this.

Seems like I remember when this law was originally being proposed.

Is it actually passed?

Sounds like it.

Oh, okay.

Which is surprising, but nothing is surprising in California.



Well, DoorDash is surprising to me.

Over a billion orders a month.

Yeah, well, soon.

They're doing 900 million.

Oh, 900 million.

Okay.

900. So let's hit the gong for, oh, that was a, yeah, I can hear it. You probably can't hear it at home.

Lock in, DoorDash, folks. Keep going. We'll wait. Call us when you hit a billion. That will impress me.



Now, I was listening to Keith Rboy, talk to Eric Newcomer, and he was saying, like, his whole DoorDash, this was just the DoorDash was the Get Food button or the I'm Hungry button on your phone. And then there's a whole bunch of hard work that you needed to do to actually deliver food.

The consumer impulse was just, I'm hungry.

And you push the button and you get food.

And it has worked to the tune of 903 million orders per month.

I wonder if there's more around Christmas.

Do they always see a December bump?

No, not really.

Huh.



December was a good month for them.

They jumped.

They actually jumped in March, in 2021.

I don't know if something happened, but they've been out of turn.

Have they ever had a down month?

I don't know.

I don't think so.

They had a rough time in September of 21,



coming out of COVID,

it went from 345 to 347,

barely any growth.

But I don't think they've ever had

a truly down,

this is quarter.

This is quarterly, I guess.

Wait, is this,



oh no,

this is monthly reporting,

but you see every four months.

So, that's possible.

Ben is getting us fired up.

He says three and a half hours,

let's go.

Let's go.



We're not quite at the three and a half hour mark.

We got two minutes left.

There was one more story we didn't get to,

Flewowle permanently halted,

Redemptions, a private credit fund aimed at retail investors. People have been talking about this

as kind of like a layman moment, but I looked at the size of the fund. It's $1.7 billion.

Fun for ants. It's a private credit fund for ants. No, not great. I remember we talked about

this story last year. They said they kind of leaked that they were considering halting redemptions.



And they were like, actually, don't worry, we're not. And then now they actually have.

not,

not.

What do you think

lock in meant?

Locked in?

You just got locked into

your investments.



No more redemptions.

It's the great lock-in.

Again, don't call it a code red.

Call it the great lock-in.

You're good.

Don't call it.

We're suspending redemptions.

Call it.



A Baja blast.

We're going to Baja blast your returns.

Yes, exactly.

To the stratosphere.

Anyways, folks, thanks for hanging out with us today.

Plank the bomb.

Let's do it.

Plant the bomb.



Great show.

A lot of fun.

always fun having Sager and Jetty on the show.

He is...

Really gets people riled up.

He's just a professional.

And so he shows up, sounds good, looks good, great takes, back and forth.

Definitely are probably our most controversial guests, just judging this by the chat, but we have a lot of fun.



Yeah, a lot of fun.

Anyway, leave us five stars on Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Have the best evening.

Nice work, brothers. I'll see you on the next one.
