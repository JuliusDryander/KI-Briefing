Starting point is 00:00:00

Let's bring him into the TV then I'll show.

Dylan, how are you doing?

Hey, good.

How are you guys doing?

Oh, salute back.

We're doing great.

Great to see you.

Did you hear the news?

Starting point is 00:00:07

America just won in overtime.

We beat the Canadians.

I did not hear that news.

In the Olympics.

In hockey.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

It's great.

Starting point is 00:00:14

There's a lot to celebrate.

Yes.

But give us the news in your world.

How are things going?

It's good.

We're working hard, having fun.

But yeah, we just did our earnings and,

really strong results.

Starting point is 00:00:31

We're super excited.

2025 was just a massive year for us,

and the fourth quarter was our best quarter yet.

So we-40% year-over-year growth, right?

You got it.

That's huge.

We did 304 million in revenue.

Wow.

Starting point is 00:00:47

And then also, yeah, we, I mean, look at the whole year.

I mean, we just shipped so much.

Went from four to eight products, launched over 200 features.

And most recently, earlier this week, on Tuesday, we launched a quad code to Figma design

pathway where you can go from code to the Figma Canvas.

And I'm really excited about how we can do this entire round trip.

Yeah.

And make it possible so that wherever you start, we can give you a way to go anywhere on

Starting point is 00:01:18

the Vigma platform.

Do you think people are sort of underappreciating that loop because so many of the

experiences with agentic coding systems like ClodCode or very toy projects.

Like the first time I used Codex on desktop, I just remade the TVPN homepage to look like,

to look like Berkshire Hathaway's website.

And it's like, I just took a screenshot.

I didn't need to do any real work.

It was a five-minute thing.

Starting point is 00:01:44

And I think a lot of people are amazed by the like toy projects, but then they don't really think about what's happening when there's a design system.

This is a large organization.

This is an enterprise.

This is going to be something that's enduring.

And so can you share a little bit more about that flywheel and what it takes to actually put these tools to use in a serious way?

You know, I think it's actually really important even when you're maybe it's my mindset.

I'm a perfectionist.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:02:09

Even for the toy projects, I want to go figure out like what is the best expression of my fun toy project.

Sure.

You know, maybe something like a brochure, uh, halfway website is a fairly constrained form factor.

And so, uh, maybe that's not the thing.

the best example.

It's like HTML 3.

I recently made, for example, my friend was like, I want to go viral in this year

and that it was a birthday.

Starting point is 00:02:35

Like my goal for this year of my life is to go viral.

Okay.

Well, that's kind of weird, but cool.

And so I made them a website.

A lot of space to explore there.

There's a lot of ways to go viral.

Some can be good.

Go on an airplane.

Starting point is 00:02:48

Yeah.

Yeah.

What I should have done is, hey, said, hey, go talk to these guys.

But instead, I made them a website with Figma Make and made it really beautiful and trying a few different directions out.

And yeah, you know, very quickly got to, okay, here is sort of with some custom prompting, like a list of ways for them to go viral given who they are.

And then it's all collected together in a nice way.

But even for a fun project like that, that's just like, you know, I'm not.

going to send to them. They're going to do whatever they do. I don't know if they're going to look at it more

Starting point is 00:03:26

than a few times or even a few times. But I don't know. For me, I want to go explore wide on

enterprise. Yeah, you absolutely need to go think deeply about what's going to make the best product

experience for your customers. And that's not going to be just a we're going to go code it up and

we're going to do whatever we come up with first. You're going to go actually think through the option

space and try to figure out what it is that you want to go.

steer towards. That is critical. And if you don't think about that as a system, if you don't

actually use all the components you've standardized on the styles, then you're not going to

appear the same way to your customer throughout the entire user journey. And it has to really

Starting point is 00:04:10

tie together with brand as well as your product, as well as your point of view and your marketing

and your messaging. So it's super important to make it so that you're able to have all that come

together and just being in code I think is very linear.

It might be running fast, but it might be running towards the wrong direction.

Yeah.

What's driving the Figma Make growth?

Is that the same archetype as the Figma user does diverge in any interesting ways?

What can you share about like how interesting ways people are using Figma Make and also how

Starting point is 00:04:44

you're thinking about growing that product?

Yeah.

When you look at Figma Make,

I think what's really cool is to see how many non-designers are using it.

Okay.

And that is something that we've really picked up on.

It's not just designers that are going in and making really amazing prototypes

through Figma Design, but also folks are coming in and making these files and

Starting point is 00:05:11

prototypes and actually full working web apps and experiences.

I mean, 60% of files created in FigmaMake are non-designers at this point.

Wow. Which is amazing.

Yeah, I mean, that was a big part of the original Figma thesis was that there were going to be non-designers using this tool.

Yeah, basically, if you looked at the TAM of the business, purely on a product designer basis, it didn't look like it would be business today.

I don't think you ever had a job as a designer, right?

Yeah, and yet I've used Figma every day for a decade.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:05:45

So, yeah, that's interesting.

How do you think about the growth of that product in terms of adding plug-ins, features, hosting, deployment, uptime, edge distribution?

Like, that could grow into its whole thing, right?

Yeah, or maybe a more simple question is like, where do you want to partner or do you want to build yourself?

Yeah.

I mean, I think that we're going to see tons of partnerships for things like Figma Make where you need to be able to pull in context from whatever.

systems people use and then with that use it to help create and help access data.

But more importantly, I think that it's really key that we both create a simple surface

Starting point is 00:06:32

that if you're just getting started, you can use.

And also we figure out how do we make it so that you're able to go above and beyond

and go really professional and do things.

that basically require a skill ladder to traverse.

But visual first.

That's the thesis is visual first.

But yeah, make users grew 70% quarter over quarter.

I mean, we're seeing great adoption.

Starting point is 00:07:00

I think people are really resonating with the product

and finding all sorts of fun and awesome use cases for it.

And I think there's such opportunity,

given the way that our active users of Make

are also using Figma Design

to bring new services closer together.

which I think it's back to that a divergent point because make is still too linear for my taste.

Oh, interesting.

Starting point is 00:07:24

What are, what feature requests are you prioritizing and most thinking about and what are some maybe more wild feature requests that you may, Figma may not get to?

Well, I mean, there's a feature request in this conversation to go do edge competing.

I don't think that's going to happen.

You know, all of the folks out there working on edge competing, you know, come partner with us.

Hardware.

We're not in your space.

Don't worry.

Hardware.

Starting point is 00:07:54

I want a hardware device.

You mentioned taste.

How have you been reacting to the taste discourse?

Is taste a new?

How many different cycles of taste discourse has happened?

This is the first time I've ever heard of taste.

Have happened since Figma was started.

I think about companies like linear who,

Starting point is 00:08:13

who like to me exemplify like a taste driven company and and how many of these cycles were they

like oh they they care about this again great um i mean look like i think that from the start of

figma you know the the goal was not just to get everyone doing design or making design software usable

by everybody and expanding the market that wasn't the way we thought about it it was like

how do we get people starting this journey where they can actually

actually go and be more expressive, more creative, and, you know, really start to solve problems.

And, you know, maybe it was a bit of like projection.

But for me at least, I wake up in the morning, I'm like, I want to go create software.

Starting point is 00:08:58

I want to go build stuff.

And so how do I make it that anyone with that impulse can just do that?

That doesn't mean they're all going to have like taste and craft and epic design skills.

I mean, I think for the rest of my life, I can work on that.

and many designers have made that a lifelong pursuit.

Yeah, yeah.

There's something that's very real where you start on this creative journey

and your taste level can be way above your skill level.

Starting point is 00:09:25

And it's incredibly frustrating.

And some people start and they just stop because they feel like,

like I have this idea for what I want something to look like or be like.

And I'm kind of like trying to make things that match that and I can't.

And that's part of why.

AI in general is like incredibly exciting because it can help you close that gap faster and potentially help you close that gap almost instantly in some circumstances.

But you might create a hundred different outputs before getting to the one that actually meets that, you know, level.

Yeah. I think that the key thing is that you really have to go wide and explore and then challenge yourself.

Starting point is 00:10:04

If you find areas where you're going, hey, actually, I don't feel like I am.

liking this enough, I'm not happy enough with a solution, then you've got to go keep pushing.

But the more you can sample the possibility space and see some things that you like and you don't

like, gives them to react to. And I think that the constant thing is you need to be constantly

critiquing and thinking about what is it that you like, you don't like, et cetera. And, you know,

people talk about agents all the time. And I'm upset.

with agents too. We all are, right? Agents are cool.

How many Mac minis do you have?

Starting point is 00:10:47

No comment. No comment. He's the reason that

Mac minis are sold out.

I swear I am not Claudebod.

But anyway, but yeah, but like I think that the bigger point

to point back to taste is, you know, if an agent can do it for you,

then unless you've got some amazing, sophisticated prompting

and super unique, like an agent can do it for someone else.

And so I think that this discourse on like agents are just going to do all the things.

Starting point is 00:11:17

Well, what is different about your setup than others?

We just have to have something different there in order to not think that you're just going to get the same thing else is going to get.

Yeah.

Well, even then, I don't know if it's going to get you to see extraordinary.

Yeah.

Yeah, we were in a post yesterday that was sort of trying to quantify.

the background that leads to taste.

And he was basically saying that like Steve Jobs was incredibly high IQ,

Starting point is 00:11:47

but also had like varied training data in that he had like been homeless and like

traveled the world and like got all these like bizarre experiences.

And I'm wondering if that like resonates with you or you think that it's it's like too

difficult to even quantize what makes for a great designer or great taste.

You know, I think that the great designers I've met through my life have

come from so many different backgrounds.

You know, a lot of folks have come through rigorous design training.

Like they just went through a system.

Starting point is 00:12:19

Sure.

And other people, wow, they went and created, you know, their band poster.

And that got them into like graphic design.

And then somehow they like showed up at the right house and crashed in someone's couch

and then became a product designer and then never went back.

You know, so everything in between.

There's not really a pattern.

people have traveled the world and you know gone on the meditation retreats and some people

Starting point is 00:12:44

are like as buttoned up as you could get and just totally straight-laced uh i think that the nice

thing about designers is they're so unique uh and there's no pattern matching yeah how do you think about

variability of design going forward are we so excited are we at sort of a narrowing period because most people

come with just a generic prompt?

Because I saw your Figma

make examples and I was like

I didn't even know that was possible.

There were so, but I was like I would never

Starting point is 00:13:19

have gotten there. So is,

are there going to be tools to maybe help

people like be inspired

by your background which has a whole bunch of

variation on it? I don't know.

Yeah, I'm just, I'm just wondering because

I mean, we were just talking about a company

that it feels like the prompt was like

Starting point is 00:13:35

copy Jordi's website.

Maybe it wasn't.

Maybe it's just coincidence, but it felt like, okay, like there wasn't, there wasn't like a twist here where it was like, oh, just do something completely different that's never been applied to this particular category, at least.

Like, steal from a different niche instead of from the one that's like very, very similar.

But I'm wondering how you're seeing like variation in design take hold in the world.

Yeah, this is the moment, I think, where we're going to see the pendulum go from, I mean, let's look.

back, right? So we had the flash era, GeoCities. I'm not saying it was high quality era,

but there is a lot of variation. Yeah. And then iPhone comes down as like skeuomorphism and then

Starting point is 00:14:20

Swiss minimalist design. And nothing wrong with Swiss minimalist design. Like that is a really cool

and storied field and lineage. But it is just one part of the greater aesthetic realm. And we can go into

there's such interesting places and try so many interesting patterns on the UX side too.

It's not just UI and the visuals, it's also the structure, the IA, the way that people

navigate through these things and interaction patterns.

And I think there's innovation that's going to be flourishing on all of it.

I'm just so excited to see the internet get like really dynamic and really visual and people

try things that they just have.

Starting point is 00:15:08

haven't seen a while and things that people haven't seen ever because I think that that's

what's going to take to stand out now.

There's been so much there.

Like the exponential curve of software is just it's taking off in a way that it's always

been exponential, but now it's vertical.

We talked about this before.

And in order to stand out, I mean, you guys have a show that you're managing to actually

break through and get people to be watching this.

Starting point is 00:15:35

Like, this is not normal, right?

But you have worked very hard, very diligently to create the conditions under which you have this audience.

Well, this is the thing that everyone has to figure out now is how are you going to actually get any attention in a world where there's constantly new information?

Even beyond America winning the ice hockey match.

Yeah, since I've been thinking about how.

how Gen AI is impacting marketing.

It's allowing somebody has like a unique idea.

And then it used to be like you had like at least a month to kind of like run with that unique idea,

Starting point is 00:16:17

maybe three months if it was like, you know, a specific campaign or something like that.

And now somebody can literally fast follow you and your idea almost immediately.

So good ideas always get copied.

Yeah.

But they get copied even faster now.

Another thing that I was thinking about when you were talking about kind of the explosion of UI.

John had a had a post yesterday that he was sort of jokingly making like a BuzzFeed

stylistical like five five features that could explode your LLM's usage or something like

Starting point is 00:16:48

that and one of them was like caching and people have had this idea of like generative

UIs UIs that's being made like on the fly and I feel like we may get we may like have products

where that's happening right like you're in an

and a UI is being generated, but it will still make sense.

Like if there's something that happens all the time, like thousands, millions of times

a day, billions, like, it does not, it really stops making sense to just generate it on

the fly.

It's like, hey, this happens a lot.

Starting point is 00:17:20

Let's like, make the best version of this and we don't need a light.

I had a poster on this actually, exactly this topic.

I can send it to you if you want, but the, um, basically the post was about how the length

of time that an artifact will exist for.

is inversely proportional to the likelihood it's going to be generated.

And I think this is true across media.

So basically, like, if you are writing a book,

unlikely that you're going to have, like, AI, just generate your book.

Starting point is 00:17:50

Amazon booksellers would like the word.

Yeah, you can just say you don't read adult romantic fiction.

We get it.

No, no, no.

I think, I think, continue.

Yeah, yeah.

But, like, I think, you know, something that's like a ad that will live for, you know, a few hours.

Totally.

Starting point is 00:18:11

Like, yeah, probably you're now an agent that can generate that.

Totally.

Yeah.

Yeah, the difference is, like, you're making an asset for, to respond to with a meme format to news.

Makes a lot of sense to, like, put that through a nanobanana or chat GPT.

But if you're putting, making a billboard, maybe you're still using AI to some degree, but you're going to invest, like, significantly.

I think if you're going to make a billboard that's going to cost money, it's going to be up for a month, and, you know, a lot of people are going to see it.

I think you're going to have a human touch.

Starting point is 00:18:43

We actually with Weavey, now Fima Weave, we've, you know, we've been looking a lot at these kinds of use cases.

And, you know, one thing that just we think will have a lot is how you know this first prompt.

But then you actually want to go and have it go through a process where you can transform and mutate it and almost like clay that's being shipped.

you can treat it like a medium to get to a final output that's amazing.

So like in our earnings call, we talked about how in video, which they've actually done

as a public case study, they put the entire making of this keynote online and they used

weevy with it.

And what they did was they had all these robots and they needed to basically get to a 20K

Starting point is 00:19:24

image of this whole scene.

Like how do you create a 20K image with perfect lighting throughout?

I mean, it's really tough.

Yeah.

So they had a whole custom pipeline with maybe they did.

Yeah.

And just like the amount of work to go do that at scale of that pixel density is immense.

And I thought their workflow was super cool as all.

Starting point is 00:19:48

That's awesome.

I love it.

Yeah, please send us that.

And thank you so much for taking the time to come chat with us.

Thank you for having me.

Always a good time.

We were so fired up seeing the results from yesterday, really a testament.

to how locked in the team.

Starting point is 00:20:06

The team is amazing.

Yeah.

They're working so hard and they're just an incredible team.

I'm so grateful.

And I think it's a proof point.

I mean, I think that we're going to see it over and over again,

whether it's the taste discourse, just customers with Figma.

But design is a differentiator.

Starting point is 00:20:24

Like figure it out, go learn design, hire your designer.

Otherwise, you're going to have a hard time.

That's my last message.

Well, thank you so much for taking the time.

Great to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon.
