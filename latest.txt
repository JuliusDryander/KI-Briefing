(59:32) - 𝕏 Timeline Reactions

(01:31:33) - Blake Dodge, a journalist at Pirate Wires, transitioned from investigative reporting at Business Insider to focus on optimistic tech narratives. She discusses California's proposed wealth tax, highlighting billionaire departures due to concerns over the tax's retroactive nature and its impact on business. Dodge also emphasizes the importance of tech leaders engaging in visible public works to foster goodwill amid growing inequality.

(01:46:50) - Fredrik deBoer, a writer and former academic, now authors a Substack newsletter and writes books, enjoying the independence of self-publishing. He discusses his skepticism toward exaggerated claims about AI's imminent impact on the economy, highlighting the inconsistency between dire predictions and the reluctance of AI proponents to commit to specific, measurable outcomes. To challenge these assertions, deBoer proposed a wager with blogger Scott Alexander, betting that in three years, economic indicators would remain within normal ranges, thereby questioning the narrative of an impending AI-driven economic upheaval.

(02:05:00) - Sohail Prasad, Founder and CEO of Destiny (D/XYZ), previously founded Forge, a private securities marketplace that went public in 2022. He discusses the creation of Destiny Tech100, a closed-end fund listed on the NYSE under ticker DXYZ, designed to provide public investors access to private technology companies. Prasad explains the fund's structure, investment strategy, and recent investments, including a $100 million secondary purchase in Anthropic.

(02:17:25) - Travis Brashears, co-founder and CEO of Mesh Optical Technologies, has a background in laser technology from high school through his tenure at SpaceX, where he contributed to the development of space laser communication systems. In the conversation, he discusses Mesh Optical's first product—a pluggable transceiver designed to enhance GPU cluster connectivity within data centers by eliminating power-hungry components, thereby improving efficiency. He also highlights the company's commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, aiming to scale production to millions of units by 2027 to meet the growing demand for optical interconnects in AI data centers.

(02:28:18) - Evan Spiegel, co-founder and CEO of Snap Inc., discusses the implementation of safeguards in generative video features to prevent misuse, the expansion of Snapchat's developer ecosystem with over 400,000 developers creating lenses, and the potential of tools like Easy Lens to democratize lens creation through prompts. He also highlights the contrast between user-generated content and AI-generated content, emphasizing the importance of authentic, original content in driving engagement.

Starting point is 00:00:00

You're watching TVPN.

Jordy's juggling.

It's Wednesday, February 18, 2026.

We are live from the TV.

We are so back.

The Temple of Technology, the Fortress of Finance, the capital of capital.

Let me tell you about ramp.com, baby.

Times Money, save both.

Starting point is 00:00:16

Easy-use corporate cards, bill pay, accounting, a whole lot more, all in one place.

We have a great show for you today, folks.

Specifically, Tyler Cosgrove has been on a little bit of a tear with the market maps.

He dropped the market.

He made the final market map.

final market map. We don't need any more market maps because Tyler made a market map that has

every company on it. Let's pull up his latest market map. It looks like the United States for

some VC associate out there that was making a market map and was just devastated. All my,

Starting point is 00:00:48

all the companies I was going to put on the market map are now on this market map,

which is in the timeline, by the way. And it's very blue. And you did see.

select Google, can you walk us through how you built this particular market map of every company

on it? It's every company that has a Wikipedia article, correct? Correct, yeah. So the one we're

showing it, that's the wrong one. That's for later. So basically, over winter break, actually,

I was interested in this thing where, like, okay, on Wikipedia, there's like all sorts of, like,

Wikipedia, I think is like a very underrated data source. And there's like all sorts of cool things

I think you can do, right? You mean Grogopedia, right? Well, so Grogopedia is a little different because

Starting point is 00:01:28

it's like generated on the fly, right?

But basically, you know, whatever.

What I'm doing is I took every Wikipedia article,

there's like seven and a half million English ones,

and I ran them through an embedding model.

It was Quen-3, Embedding 4B, I think.

You speak Chinese?

Yeah, Wohshaon, Zhongwo.

Starting point is 00:01:48

Whoa, he's got it down.

He said.

Okay.

So I got an embedding for every single article, right?

So it's like basically every article has a vector.

it's like 2,500.

You did this a while ago, right?

The whole Wikipedia embedding,

Starting point is 00:02:02

or did you re-embed?

This was like a month ago.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember.

So then basically I took all the articles,

I found all the ones that are about companies, enterprises, right?

Which is basically, you can find some direction in the embedding space

that's like the correspondence to how much, like, companyness something as, right?

So you just find all the ones at the end.

Starting point is 00:02:21

Oh, you don't filter by like Wikipedia's categorization of whether or not.

So I use that, but that's not inclusive of,

every single company.

Oh, interesting.

So it's like a little bit blurry.

Because some things are like, well, is it a company?

Is it not?

Yeah, I noticed some like railroads on here that

Starting point is 00:02:35

looked like maybe they're companies,

but they're like state owned and where does that fit in?

It's kind of a blurry thing.

So you can just use just what Wikipedia says.

But you can basically find things that are companies.

And then you have an embedding for every single one.

So it's this big vector, super high dimensional space.

If you map it down to 2D, you can have this,

Starting point is 00:02:53

like, cool 2D map, which is basically what I did.

So you can see there's these big clusters, right?

So it's like, in the top left, it's all these theater companies or there's space companies.

I noticed the aviation companies were pretty far away from the train companies.

Is that the way?

Yeah, because you knew there was kind of like a bit of a rivalry.

Yeah, rivalry.

They need to be, you got to keep those apart.

Starting point is 00:03:14

It'll just start fighting.

Like when you map something down from like, you know, there's like 2,000 dimensions down to 2D, it's like very hard to keep like a ton of things.

And it just randomly looked like the United States.

Yeah, that has nothing to do with, like, that was totally random.

Because I looked at it and I was like, oh, okay, there's a lot of companies in Florida, a lot of companies in the northeast.

Yeah, I didn't even like, I was like, oh, it kind of looks like.

And then I was like, what is this enclave in Canada?

Why does that, is that Alaska or something?

Starting point is 00:03:37

But in fact, it has nothing to do with the United States.

It just happens to look like the United States.

Yeah, but this, so it's like actually interactive so you can like look up a company and you can find where it is and stuff.

Tyler Cosgrove.com slash Wikipedia underscore map.

Dot HTML.

Wow.

Really a wordsmith with the URLs there, Tyler.

Couldn't use a TLD.

Starting point is 00:03:56

list domain.

There are some fun ones in here.

Anyway, that's a fun project.

All the links take you to Wikipedia.

Go check it out.

Market maps are basically done.

But a lot of the Neo Labs are not on this market map.

Quickly, let me tell you about Restream, one live stream, 30 plus destinations.

Starting point is 00:04:15

If you want to multistream, go to Restream.com.

And let's click over to Tyler's market map of the Neo Labs.

Because we've been tracking the NeoLab boom.

We've had a lot of these founders.

the show. We came out of the world where we were like, okay, there's deep mind, there's Google,

there's open AI, now we got Anthropic, there's thanking machines, and there's a couple

different companies. But the Neo Labs have exploded. They have a term that's been coined.

Sarah Guo was actually, I think, the first person that came on the show and sort of broke it down

Starting point is 00:04:48

for us around the Christmas episode. But since then, the Neo Lab, like taxonomy, has evolved. And so

we needed to build a market map. So, Tyler, take us through what's going on in the world of

Neo Labs these days. Yeah. So Neolab is kind of this interesting term. It's very broad. People

say, like, Neolab, it's not very clear what they mean. Because there's, like, broadly, I think

it generally is like... And this will make it clearer? Yes. I think after this, it'll be pretty

obvious, like, what, you know, what used to be looking at, how to think about these different companies.

Yeah. I don't want to be more confused at the end of this. Yeah. That would be a disaster if that

happened. Yeah. That's not going to happen. This is going to be easy. Okay, got it.

Starting point is 00:05:24

Got it, got it.

Cool.

Okay, so let's just start.

Okay, so you have NeoLab, right?

Yes.

So Neo is prefix.

Okay, let's be relative to something.

Yes.

Starting point is 00:05:31

So Neo is relative to like your Tad Lab.

This is your big lab.

Traditional lab.

This is your, yeah, this is your open AI.

Let's give it up for the big labs.

Yeah.

They don't get enough credit today.

The open data centers.

Starting point is 00:05:41

Yeah.

So this is going to be your open AI, your deep mind,

your anthropic.

Okay.

Yeah, XAI.

XAI kind of fits in there too.

Even though it's a newer trad lab,

it fits in with the big lab.

Starting point is 00:05:52

Yeah, a lot of money.

Dario, I think on Torekash, he was like, yeah, three, maybe four labs, right?

So the force is probably XAI.

Yeah.

I think you can also kind of throw in a mistral in there.

Okay.

Oh, yeah, mistral is a little bit older.

Yeah, I mean, mistral, there's much of these labs that were basically founded in the, like,

Starting point is 00:06:09

two or three years before Chachapiti and then in the like six months after.

Yeah.

So I think XAI's in there.

Yeah.

And these specifically, these, I feel like those trad labs, it's like, they did a transformer-based, pre-training run.

They have their own base pre-trained.

Maybe it's not at the frontier, but at least they're playing that game.

They're not doing fine-tuning.

Starting point is 00:06:29

They're not doing something else.

So that's sort of like you're in the Trad Lab world when you're thinking about like a big

pre-train run loosely.

Yeah.

I mean, especially if you're talking about these big pre-trains, it's really just these four.

No one else is really at that scale.

Yep.

But then, okay, so Mistral kind of brings us down into what I call the sovereign labs.

Starting point is 00:06:45

Okay.

So, I mean, you know, if you kind of look at this, it's basically just labs that are not in

America. But I think also there actually is some meaning to this. So like Mistral, you've seen

Mistral become kind of the leader in European AI, right? So I think it was in, was it Sweden maybe,

they're bringing a new data center. Yeah, Sweden. So they're kind of becoming like,

lots of stuff going on in France too. McCrone is always talking about Mistral. Yep. It's a big leader.

Cohere is also kind of, I think it has like a very, you know, Canadian. It's a Canadian company.

Yes. Yes. But also has done their own pre-trains. No ties to the curling team, though.

Starting point is 00:07:18

Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

No ties.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It's important to put some distance between that scandal.

Yeah.

And then you can go down.

Starting point is 00:07:26

You can kind of see all your Chinese open source labs.

This is your Kwan, Deep Sea, Kemi.

Unitary is also in there, right?

Unitary, I think, so as we'll see later, there's also, I have sectioned for, like,

robotics labs.

Sure.

But this is very clearly, like, you know, this is the Chinese.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:07:42

Take us back in time now.

What was going on before the Trad Labs broke out?

Yeah.

So here I have this section, Legacy Labs.

So these are ones that are kind of more entrenched in these big enterprises.

Yep.

So you have stuff like Microsoft Research, AT&T of Bell Labs, right?

Oh, Bell Labs, yeah.

Starting point is 00:08:01

I forgot about Bell Labs.

You know what?

You know why they call it Bell Labs?

Why do they call it Bell Labs?

Alexander Graham Bell.

Yeah, it was founded by him.

Yeah.

Bell Labs.

Starting point is 00:08:13

Okay, but also you have stuff like you have fair Facebook AI research.

This was like, I mean,

There's so many OG research papers that came out of fair.

Yeah.

Jan Lacoon.

Jan Lacoon used to be head of before it transitioned to MSL.

To MSL.

Okay.

Starting point is 00:08:30

So then, I think let's move up here.

Around your Trad Lab, you'll say have Post Lab, right?

P-O-A-S-T.

Yes, these are posters.

Yeah, these are labs where you get a lot of posters, right?

So obviously this is opening eye.

You got Rune, Anthropic, a lot of, you know, Shulto, et cetera.

You got a lot of great posters.

Starting point is 00:08:48

Prime Intellect.

They're great posters.

Brown, a bunch of Anans at Prime Intellect doing great stuff over there.

For sure.

And then you kind of get into the core.

The proper Neo Lab.

Yeah, the proper Neo Lab.

So this is also a bit hard to identify because, like, what is actually the core of a

Starting point is 00:09:03

new lab?

What are these different kind of offshoots?

I think Prime Intellect is kind of the prototypical, like quintessential Neolab

when you think of it.

Where you basically have, it's like fairly recent.

Yeah.

It's still very much research focused.

Okay.

Starting point is 00:09:18

Sure, they have enterprise, like, you know, thinking about different stuff, but at the core of it,

you're still, like, trying to find these, like, new novel approaches.

It's research.

You're hiring researchers.

It's not just, like, engineers, sales guys, et cetera.

So let's...

Wouldn't Sikana be more of, like, a sovereign lab?

Yeah, yeah.

Starting point is 00:09:37

I mean, so a lot of these can fit in all different places.

Sakana would be, yeah, Japanese, maybe.

Okay, and you put MSL in here because it's a new project.

Yeah, this one was also a bit hard.

It doesn't feel like a trad lab because, I mean, maybe it has the scale, but it's just...

It's newer.

They haven't shipped yet.

Yeah, it's new lab, right?

Starting point is 00:09:56

I mean, it's so recent.

Definitionally.

Thinking machines is my classic go-to NeoLab.

I feel like it's post-open AI, Exodus and sort of open AI is nothing without its people.

You know, you get the spinouts and you think thinking machines and SSI are two of like the first case studies that sort of set the tempo for,

okay, it's possible to do some research outside of the big Trad labs.

And so that's where you get the neolab boom from.

And then a lot of the other companies I feel like are saying,

Starting point is 00:10:27

okay, we're going to do something similar to thinking machines or SSI.

We're going to commercialize earlier, late.

But we're following in that, and we're benchmarking to that.

Oh, they raise $2 billion.

We're raising $200 million.

It's easier.

There's a 10% chance that we are at their scale.

So you can underwrite it that way.

Starting point is 00:10:42

Yeah.

So Thing Machines also brings us to what I call the TradSAS lab.

Okay.

Sass lab, you've trad Sass Lab.

So I think the way I think about this is the trad Sass Labs are trying to basically use the data that's inside these big enterprises, pull them out with AI.

Okay.

So this is thing machines, right?

The rumored idea, right, is they're doing RL for Enterprise.

Starting point is 00:11:06

A bunch of these are doing fairly similar things where it's kind of chatting with your data, using the data that's very valuable to a company, but it's going to be inside the company.

You can't really pull it out anyway.

besides having the AI be like internal.

So you have applied compute, you have pool side doing all kind of similar things in this

like enterprise LLM field.

Yeah.

And then that brings us to Neo-SAS lab, right?

Not full base pre-trains for those companies, mostly fine-tuning or RL on top of a particular

Starting point is 00:11:35

company's use case.

Yeah.

And then I have Neo-SAS lab.

This is different than TradSas.

I think these are different in that.

They're not really pulling, they're not really pulling, they're not kind of

going enterprise specific, maybe?

I think that's one way to look at it.

Starting point is 00:11:51

Also much more of like startup focus.

But they're making a product that is sold effectively as SaaS.

Yes.

So cursor, cognition, windsurf.

I have ramp labs.

Ramp labs.

These are seat-based sort of consumption-based.

But it's a product that's vended into a,

Starting point is 00:12:07

and the product is what you get and then sort of customizes as you integrate it,

but it's not, it doesn't, the conversation doesn't start with a,

with a business development relationship.

Yeah, and of course, I mean, these lines are pretty blurry.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But then, okay, let's go down to the post lab.

Okay, post lab.

This is after the lab.

Starting point is 00:12:28

Yes.

So that means like basically they train the models

and then these labs are working on top of those models.

That's how I think of it.

So you have meter, you have epoch, these are going to do e-vows.

Yep.

You have pangrum.

They're seeing is the model producing slop?

Starting point is 00:12:43

Yes.

Or is it producing text that you're using in some way?

These are purely e-valed.

They don't have necessarily AI products themselves.

They don't necessarily sell to big businesses.

But they could still be training models, right?

Like Panagram is training models that sit on top of the lab.

That's true.

Starting point is 00:12:58

That's true.

So it counts as a lab.

Yeah.

Makes sense.

Okay, what else we got?

Maybe that brings us down to the safety lab.

Yes.

So these are pretty interesting.

Starting point is 00:13:05

Anthropic kind of fits in this, right?

Because they have a big safety team.

They're doing a lot of mechanistic interpretability.

You have Goodfire.

I think they just raised at like $1.25 billion.

And they're just doing mechanistic interpretability.

Let's go.

Very interesting.

Starting point is 00:13:17

Eleuther AI is a similar kind of lab.

I know Eleuther, yeah.

Yeah.

Very cool.

There also, a lot of these are also kind of in the open source space.

Yeah, I think Stableafusion came out of a Luther AI.

Yeah, this is another label that I think I could have put on, but it's so hard to get everything to work together.

Open source, yeah.

Starting point is 00:13:33

But a lot of these are also like the core of the company is doing open source stuff.

Sure, sure, sure.

Right, so Prime Intellect.

Yeah, fair was a good example.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah.

And Open AI back in the day.

But a lot of these have bled together where OpenAI has an OSS model, but

Starting point is 00:13:45

but also a lot of consumer and enterprise.

Yeah, makes sense.

Okay, so then in contrast to the Stas Labs,

we have the Consumer Labs.

Okay, consumer labs.

So these are focused on consumers, right?

So you have Eureka Labs.

This is Andre Carpathy's project.

Starting point is 00:14:01

I don't think there's anything been released from it yet.

Education, though.

But yeah, education.

Makes sense.

It's four people.

You have humans.

Oh, it's four people, not four individuals working there.

It's four people.

Starting point is 00:14:11

It might be four people.

It might be one person.

Who knows?

He's pretty good.

Yeah.

You have humans and, right?

This is the, I think, I forget the exact phrase, it's like humanity focused.

You're going to turn human into sand?

Starting point is 00:14:24

Human sand.

Human sand.

Yeah, we got to hang out with the founders at the Super Bowl.

But they're, but, yeah, focus on creating models that work better alongside people.

Sure, sure.

Yeah, you have a lot of, like, companions, these kind of ideas, right?

You have character AI also, I guess.

Do they really own C-Dod?

Starting point is 00:14:45

What a great domain.

If that's true, I don't know.

We'll have to back to it.

Anyway.

So then that brings us down to the visual labs.

Visual labs, right?

So there's a lot of either multimodal models

or they're actually like producing video or images, right?

Starting point is 00:15:00

We've talked to a lot of these founders.

Yeah.

I feel like almost all of them have been on show.

Yeah, I mean world labs raising today.

Yeah.

Or fundraise announcement today.

Yeah.

Mid Journey, et cetera.

Starting point is 00:15:08

Leads are pretty obvious.

You have your Neo Auditory Lab.

Mid Journey is the is the sailboat logo?

Correct.

That's a good logo.

Yeah.

Okay.

You have media reality labs on there too.

Starting point is 00:15:18

Oh, okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, that makes sense.

They're visual.

Not fully AI yet, but they're getting there.

Yep.

You have, okay, you have Neo-auditory lab.

Okay.

Starting point is 00:15:27

Right, so this is going to be anything that has to do with vocals or voice or music.

Yes.

11 labs.

11 labs, of course.

Sponsor of TVPN, thank you.

Suno, right, making music.

Gemini also released a new model.

Yes, today.

Starting point is 00:15:43

Liria 3.

I didn't even know there was one or two.

It's a trilogy already?

They just got secret models that they're hiding from us.

Yeah.

So this is a very interesting field.

And then you have your legacy auditory as opposed to your new auditory, right?

So these are your old ones.

Starting point is 00:15:56

This is, well, John, do you want to talk about nuance?

Nuisance, Dragon, naturally speaking.

This is the original box software.

You buy it, install it on a Windows computer.

You can talk into a microphone and it will write down what you say.

Dictate it.

Yeah.

Using some AI, not a large language model at the time, not a transformer-based architecture.

Starting point is 00:16:14

but became a very large company.

I think it's part of Microsoft now or something.

I think it's been acquired a few times.

But, yeah, very, very interesting company.

A lot of really solid.

Free loops, yeah, that's a, you know,

you're in the lab making beads, I guess.

Yeah, that makes sense.

Starting point is 00:16:29

Okay, so now moving up, I think this is really

the very interesting section.

So this is a Neo-Trad Lab.

Yes.

So I think, what is a Neo-Trad Lab?

It's just a simple definition, clearly.

Does it even need explaining?

I think everyone gets it, right?

Starting point is 00:16:44

To your head, by the way.

Yeah, it's coming really close.

You might want to be on the other side?

To the team.

Okay.

So, Neo-Trad Lab.

Yes.

It's a Neo-Lab.

Starting point is 00:16:50

Yes.

But it's Trad.

Okay.

So what does that mean?

So basically, the way I think about a lot of these labs is that they're extremely

research-focused.

Okay.

They're also largely, they're focused on like kind of a single idea.

Starting point is 00:17:04

Yeah.

So if you think of like Open AI, very research-focused, obviously, but they're doing a lot of different things.

Yeah.

So they have.

Consumer.

Yeah.

They have consumer.

But it's even like on the product or on the research side, right, they're doing their video images.

Starting point is 00:17:18

SORA images.

Yeah, but even within like language models, I'm sure they have a, you know, continual learning team or all these like weird new shot things.

Where I think a lot of these neotrad labs are basically focused on one single moonshot idea.

Okay, so example, flapping airplanes.

They just came on.

They're talking about data efficiency.

This is kind of the one kind of moonshot idea, right?

Obviously it's like a very general broad.

Starting point is 00:17:43

There's a bunch of different ways to tackle it, but they're like, that's the problem that we're going after.

But it's one specific thing they're working on.

Yep.

And, I mean, they talk about, oh, you know, if we figured out there'll be some value, but we're not saying to sure how it's going to come out like right now.

And we're not sure how we're going to productize it necessarily.

Yeah.

But we have a really specific pieces.

So the idea is like if these labs can figure out like the core research idea, then the value will appear.

Starting point is 00:18:10

Right.

So this is, you also heard this out of Ilya with SSI, right?

Not sure how they're going to get revenue, but it'll come if they figure out a breakthrough.

A breakthrough.

If we build it, they will come.

Yes.

Worked before.

A lot of interesting things here.

Starting point is 00:18:22

So we can look at like, okay, general intuition.

Yes.

They're basically doing a lot of multimodal training where they can basically take video game data

and try to figure out how to map that on to LMs or world models or these types of things.

You have Inception.

I believe they're doing...

Dream tech.

Wait, okay, I'm thinking of logical intelligence.

Starting point is 00:18:45

They're doing like diffusion models.

Okay.

So diffusion, but for LLMs.

But for text.

Yeah, we've seen a demo from Google on that too.

Okay, Inception is doing, I think they're doing the energy-based models.

Which is kind of this word thing.

Okay, wait, I have both of those companies flipped again.

Starting point is 00:19:02

Sure.

So, yeah, I don't know why you're flipping stuff around.

Like this is literally just NeoLab 101.

You're doing a basic breakdown.

The point is that they're doing these kind of weird architectures where like energy-based model, it's like kind of different than a normal L-LM where you have this normal backcrop, stuff like this.

But the point is that these are all like very kind of weird like architectures that they're working on.

So maybe the big labs have like small teams that are working on this stuff.

But basically these people go out of the big lab.

Starting point is 00:19:30

A lot of them are coming out of the big labs.

Sure.

And they're starting these new projects.

Okay.

Like coming out of a trad lab or a or a Neo lab or a Neo lab or a Legacy Lab?

A neo-sass lab.

Exactly, yeah.

Okay, got it.

Starting point is 00:19:43

Yeah.

Okay, so now let's move up a little bit.

Yeah, what is Neo Lab Lab Lab?

Okay.

So this is, yeah, I like this one.

So these are a lot of companies that are focusing on, they're also like very research-focused,

but the point of the research is to build essentially like a researcher.

So they're recursive, right?

Starting point is 00:20:03

Okay.

So you have recursive and recursive.

Yeah, you have actually two that are recursive and recursive.

You have Richard Socher, Socher.

Okay.

You have periodic labs where they're not, they're a little bit more focused on the hardware.

Okay.

But the whole point is that they have this kind of closed loop.

Starting point is 00:20:20

Okay.

Where you can basically build a lab within the lab, right at the whole point.

You know, lab lab, you're building a lab.

Got it.

Unconventional AI, similar thing.

I think they're doing a hardware.

The product will be a lab.

They're in the lab manufacturing business.

Starting point is 00:20:33

Correct.

Got it.

Okay.

Okay.

Moving up, we have math lab.

Yes.

So these are pretty interesting.

Axiom and Harmonic.

Starting point is 00:20:40

And then you have Matt Lab.

Yes.

But these are pretty cool.

There's been a lot of good breakthroughs recently.

I think there's a bunch of Airdosh problems that are being solved, or maybe they're just being proven in some ways.

But there's a lot of interesting research coming out of these.

Harmonic is Vlad Tenev, the founder of Robin Hood.

Yes.

Starting point is 00:20:58

Correct?

Yes.

Wet labs?

Okay.

So these are your bio labs.

Oh, you got LabCorp.

Yeah, I'm familiar with LabCorp.

Lab Corp, but there's a lot of, like, biology-focused labs.

Starting point is 00:21:12

It's actually, like, I didn't know a lot of, I didn't know about a lot of these.

But there's all sorts of, like, interesting research.

So, isomorphic labs, this was spun out of, I believe, Gemini or at least Google.

Yeah, that's right.

They're working on, like, longevity and just drug development almost.

So some of these are very focused on specific forms of drug development.

Some of them are just, like, broader where they're very focused on.

longevity stuff.

Starting point is 00:21:38

Yeah.

Cool.

And then, yeah, let's go to...

Yeah, what's going on up top?

Oh yeah, up top we have labrador.

Oh, that's really important.

If you want to understand labs, you got...

You got to understand...

Starting point is 00:21:50

You got to start the foundation.

The white lab, the black lab, your chocolate lab.

Your chocolate lab.

Yeah, chocolate labs are important.

Yeah.

If you want to understand labs broadly.

Yeah.

Okay. Then moving back down, we have the neokinetic lab.

Starting point is 00:22:02

Okay.

So these are going to be your labs that are more focused on robotics.

Yes.

So you have a bunch.

Project Prometheus.

Yes.

This is Bezos's lab.

It's still kind of in stealth, which is why there's not even a logo for it.

Starting point is 00:22:13

Yeah.

You have figure, you have skilled AI.

SkillD AI is the Luke Metro project?

Yes.

Got it.

Yes.

Physical intelligence Sunday, right?

These are all your kind of neoconnect labs, right?

Starting point is 00:22:27

These are started fairly recently in the past like maybe four or five years.

Yes.

And then the Neo-Neo-Lab.

Neo-No-Lab, right.

Okay, so 1X is built.

NEO robots.

Got it.

Neo-Neo Lab.

Starting point is 00:22:40

That makes sense.

Yeah.

Yep.

And then Legacy Kinetic is the previous.

Legacy Kinetic is kind of the old gen.

Yeah.

But cooking.

They're cooking.

Starting point is 00:22:49

Waymo's cooking.

Yeah.

Cruise and Boston Dynamics have been a little bit behind.

Zook's also another self-driving car company.

There's a bunch in here that I could have included.

There was another one stealth, I think, that never really hit inflection.

Okay.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:23:02

And then you have your...

Mostly vehicle focus.

You have your dark lab.

Yes.

So this is...

Working with a...

with the government.

I have, yeah, I have Shield AI.

Starting point is 00:23:08

I also have DARPA.

DARPA is a lab.

Yeah, they invented the internet, right?

GPS.

Yeah.

DARPA net.

Yes.

That's good.

Starting point is 00:23:16

And then simulation lab.

I think that's...

Simulation lab, yes.

So, similarly, we just had them on.

And then SpaceX you could put up there

because aren't they working on this...

Yeah, the drones?

Yeah, where's Rocket Lab?

Starting point is 00:23:27

Rocket Lab needs to be on there.

That's a lab.

There's a lot of labs.

There's a lot of labs.

I mean, yeah, lab is very broad term.

Very broad term.

Well, at least it's crystal clear now.

for everyone.

Starting point is 00:23:37

Yeah, so I think this should be pretty obvious to anyone who's thinking about Neo Labs,

like how should be thinking about them now.

If you've been paying attention, this is all second nature to you.

Did you add up how much all the companies have raised?

It's got to be in the north of 200 billion.

Yeah, it's a lot.

I mean, so I didn't do that, but for all I was trying to figure out how to include the

valuations on the map.

Starting point is 00:23:58

Yeah, it was too confident.

You didn't want to, you didn't feel like you could do the math?

No, we don't know how.

Well, it's also, a lot of them are rumored.

Yeah.

It's actually like kind of hard to find out, because a lot of these are still really in stelf.

Like a lot of these neotrad labs, they basically, because the whole point is that they're doing this research stuff, they're not going to like productize early.

And also, how much do you put in the deep mine bucket?

Starting point is 00:24:19

That's a huge amount of investment.

And it's not exactly disclosed.

Do you count the TPU?

Do you count Google Cloud?

Like different allocations.

You can go really deep in the stack to understand the impact of like the broad AI buildout.

But yeah, I mean, if you just total this up, you can really just do XA.

Open AI, Open AI, Anthropic, and get like 90% of the way there.

Starting point is 00:24:40

And it's probably like 200 billion.

It's also hard because it's like evolving so fast, right?

So David Silver's lab, he used to be at Deep Mind.

Oh, I like ineffable.

Inneffable.

That's a good word.

Yeah, I think that was rumored today.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:24:54

It's indescribable.

Yeah.

But these things are coming out like every day, right?

And you put the typos in just to prove that,

what typos?

So like Sovereign Lab and then.

Sovereign.

Neffable intelligence also has a typo.

Starting point is 00:25:10

And so I just want to make sure, I wanted to make sure that people do, you put the typos in so that it was proof that you made it.

Yeah, yeah.

I don't want it.

Well, yeah, whatever you built this in doesn't have spell check, I guess.

Anyway, fantastic report.

Thanks for breaking it down.

I learned a lot, and I hope you did too.

And let me tell you about a lab, Gemini 3 Pro.

Starting point is 00:25:35

It's Google's most intelligent model yet.

State of air reasoning, next level vibe coding, and deep multimodal understanding.

And I'm also going to tell you about Century.

Century shows developers what's broken and helps them fix it fast.

That's why 150,000 organizations use it to keep their apps working.

One show, two maps.

One show, two maps.

Strong start.

Starting point is 00:25:54

Should we break down five wildly obvious fixes that will explode consumer LLM adoption?

They don't want you to know this over at the big labs.

I have some ideas.

Basically, everyone's been really focused on agentic coding and the

SaaSpocalypse and what's happening in the business to business world and the enterprise

world.

I've just been sort of like thinking back on, you know, basic improvements to the chat

apps that I use all the time because there's some really obvious stuff that I think,

Starting point is 00:26:24

I think it's in the works.

I think it's coming.

But I wanted to just sort of like get it all down in one place to think about what the next

iteration and the next breakout moment when people are like, oh, I'm using the media.

even more, I'm having a better experience, what would that look like?

So the first thing is that I realized that I've asked ChatGPT just, when was OpenAI founded,

three different times?

It's the exact same query.

Starting point is 00:26:50

Like, it doesn't need to light the GPUs on fire for that question.

The answer literally never changes.

You can cache the result.

And that's what Google does with those knowledge queries, knowledge panels.

And there's a whole bunch of different ways to deliver results that are sort of pre-cashed.

And so if you just look down, when an LLM launches, basically every question has never been asked before.

But now there's a lot of people that are just showing up with the exact same question.

Give me the history of the Roman Empire.

Starting point is 00:27:23

Give me the history of this company.

And you might not be the first person to ever ask that question, exactly.

But also if you do a little bit of fuzzy, if you do it.

do a little bit of like fuzzy search over it, you, there are probably like hundreds of thousands

of people that have asked the exact same thing. So cash those results, give them to the user instantly.

And I think this like instantaneous feeling of LMs, like they felt slow for a really long time.

They actually got slower. Like it was always sort of slow. You watch the token stream in.

But then once the reasoning models and the thinking models and the deep research and the O3

Starting point is 00:27:56

pro came out, it was like really slow. It was like close your phone and come back in 20 minutes.

That doesn't have to be the end.

end state and I don't think it will be. And I have no better example than the number two on my

list, which is cerebrous inference. So chat chagpD currently has a model called 5.2 instant. And it is

not instant at all. I fired off a prompt to 5.2 instant. And I said, no reasoning. Tell me the

history of LOMs. It took 38 seconds to deliver the full response for all the tokens to stream in.

And it does a good job. It shows you images and stuff. And it is a cool, it is a cool illustration.

But then I went over to Codex desktop, and I fired up GPT 5.3 Codex Spark Low, which is a crazy name, which we'll get to.

Starting point is 00:28:44

And it responded in under two seconds. Because it's, from what we know, Spark is incredibly quick.

Cerebrus. And it's very, very fast. And so everyone's obsessed with like the fast models in the agentic coding world because you're waiting half an hour for something to get back to you.

waiting five minutes for something you get back to you, and you're actually losing your train

of thought. But I think that applies in consumer as well. And I think the interaction of sending a

message and then just immediately getting a response before you actually think, oh, well, like,

it's waiting, I'll close the app, I'll check my messages. Oh, I got an Instagram notification.

Let me go over there. Like instant responses will keep people in the apps longer, and user minutes will

actually increase once that rolls out. So pretty simple implementation for, I think, most companies.

Starting point is 00:29:29

My big question is like, I know Google has a huge advantage with TPU, but I don't know if they have like an answer to cerebrus specifically.

And Vindia just brought GROC, which can do, I think, some of the same things.

So I'm curious to know how every lab solves the like fast responses question because that feels like an important piece of the puzzle.

It's not the only piece of the puzzle, but it's an important feature.

And I think we're going to see it rolling out to consumer LLMs very, very soon.

And I do think it'll be an interesting moment for people to both ask a question and just, boom, it's as fast as going to Wikipedia and just seeing, like, okay, everything's rendered. It's thoughtful. It's what you want.

And on the flip side, I think that it could make people a lot more chatty with them, like actually asking follow-up questions because you don't feel that cost of like, oh, if I ask you to follow up and tell me more or re or go a different direction, like I have to wait. I have to wait. So I might just close the app.

Speaking of GPT 5.3 Codex Spark low, no more model names.

Starting point is 00:30:32

Like truly no more model names in consumer AI, LLM chat apps, like ever.

Like just bury them so deep in the UI that you never see them.

And people will complain.

People will be like, I wanted it to be easier to pick.

I like picking between pro and thinking and fast and instant.

I know what I want for everything.

People will complain.

But it will all inspire the model.

Starting point is 00:30:56

team to grind harder and the model routing team has a hard job to do but they will

eventually figure it out and eventually you should be able to just talk to the model.

You can already do this in chat to pete you can say hey think really hard about this

question and give me a really thorough answer and it'll go it'll switch from instant to

thinking. I don't know that you can trigger pro from that I haven't actually

experienced that I did try and trigger a deep research report I said hey please deep

research the Roman Empire for me and it does not fire off a deep research report

Deep research is buried under like a plus button and you have to select it and say,

Starting point is 00:31:28

okay, I actually want you to do this thing.

And then it takes you down the deep research like workflow,

which I understand is like for inference reasons.

They don't just want you firing off deep research reports all the time.

But I think in the future, like the model router should be very intelligent about,

okay, this is a question that people have asked thousands of times.

Let's just go get it from a database, which is crazy to think in the age of AI that you wouldn't even be hitting a GPU.

But I think that's going to be real.

Starting point is 00:31:52

And then I think on the other side, like,

you should, it should detect, like, okay, this person wants something that's far beyond anything

that we've ever worked on before.

We've got to go search the internet.

We got to write some code.

We got to do a whole ton of stuff.

I'm going to need 10 minutes.

So let's fire up deep research, right?

Starting point is 00:32:09

Fourth, ads.

We've talked about this.

But we got to get them in the LLMs.

We've got to get them everywhere because I was thinking about the death of Google Reader.

I don't think you were ever a Google Reader guy, were you?

But it was amazing.

You could take all these RSS feeds from all these different blogs during the blogosphere.

You could put Marginal Revolution, Tyler Cowan's blog, all these different things in there,

Starting point is 00:32:31

and just kind of scroll through them really quickly.

And Google wound up killing it, and everyone was like really upset.

And the reason was, I think, because they never really got on the Google ad flywheel,

where there was real, like, revenue generation.

Yeah, and was that just that it didn't hit a scale that enabled it makes sense?

So the failure of every Google project that has failed is always a question of, like,

like, was it because they weren't making money from it,

or was it because they hadn't monetized it yet?

Starting point is 00:32:59

Or it just never got big enough.

If it has a million weekly active,

it's not probably worth keeping around.

Totally, totally.

But my takeaway from Google's surface area

of products that are successful and loved,

Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android,

like these are all direct funnels for the ads flywheel.

Starting point is 00:33:24

And so you can see that they're driving the bottom line.

There's a whole bunch of folks on the team that are getting excited when they're hitting their numbers, when they're making more money for the business.

And so they just get more and more resources, more and more engineering effort, everything gets better.

And I think that not only are ads the best way to deliver high quality products to the broadest possible audience, but they just make products better top to bottom.

And yes, there's the stated versus revealed preference thing.

And yes, you might want to pay to not have ads like you do on YouTube.

many people do. But I do think that that ads flywheel is going to be really, really important as the inference gets really good.

And right on time, perplexity ends ads experiment.

Starting point is 00:34:05

I saw that.

This was the news from this morning in the information from Catherine.

He says perplexity is no longer offering ads.

Executive told the Financial Times.

The AI search startup is pulling back from this line of business as rival OpenAI.

Start showing its users ads in chat, GBT earlier this month.

The company said it worried ads would undermine users' trust in their platform with an executive saying the challenge with ads is that a user would just start doubting everything.

I don't buy this at all.

Starting point is 00:34:38

Arvin has a history of kind of just like trying to provoke Open AI at every turn.

And so coming out, perplexity in my view, like, that this is.

This is just somewhat bearish, right?

They're trying to serve as many people as possible

all over the world.

The best way to do that is going to have an ad-supported tier

kind of bailing on this moment.

I don't know.

Starting point is 00:35:07

Maybe it's not worth reading too much into it,

but a little bit early to throw in the towel

on the economic engine that is driven the internet

for its entire history.

Yeah, I mean, we talked to a lot of founders who have brands

and they love advertising.

And I think that's another side.

side of this, which is that when like a lot of entrepreneurs and also people who work at businesses

Starting point is 00:35:30

want to grow their businesses and they have fond, you know, memories or affiliations with

Facebook and Google because that's how they grew their companies. And when you talk to somebody

like Sean Frank at the Ridge, he's like, I'm going to be first in line to advertise on chat

GPT. I can't wait for that. It's converting so well already I want more of that business. And

we didn't really hear that with the perplexity ad product.

We didn't hear people lining up to buy ads in that product.

So maybe it was not going as well.

Yeah, the other thing is they thought.

Starting point is 00:36:01

So according to the information,

perplexity, started testing advertising in 2014,

less than a year into its test.

Taz Patel, the executive leading the ads effort,

left the company in perplexity.

It only led in less than half a percent of the brands

that wanted to advertise in the chat spot.

So there was like a bunch of demand.

Starting point is 00:36:19

They barely let anybody use it,

and then they bailed on it.

Interesting.

And so...

Interesting.

Well, the last one is somewhat related to OpenClawe.

But I think way down the funnel, beyond the 20-minute deep research project,

you probably want to be able to fire off something that looks like Claude Code Code, or OpenClaar or Codex,

Starting point is 00:36:39

to write lots and lots of code and solve a really, really hard problem.

And so many reasoning models can already write some Python and execute it,

but it's clear that everyone wants to go further, hence the Mac Mini Boom.

and I'm not actually sure how important access

to the local file system is to most consumers.

Like when I think about what's,

like most of the data in an average internet user's life

is mirrored in the cloud.

Starting point is 00:37:06

I think they care about their camera role,

they care about their email, their messages,

and almost everything's in the cloud.

I've noticed this when I move from one computer to the next

or I move from a phone.

I'm like, wait, I didn't actually.

There was a time when it was like, oh, you're moving computers.

Like, get an external hard drive.

Starting point is 00:37:25

Like, make sure you drag all your folders, all your files over.

Most of the stuff's mirrored to iCloud.

That can be accessed via an API.

It requires a business development deal, probably.

But it does seem feasible.

And a lot of the LLMs have hooks into Gmail already.

I think all three major LLM apps have Gmail integrations already,

and more integrations are coming.

Starting point is 00:37:50

clearly. And so I'm not sure that you need to replicate open claw and have it running on a

dedicated piece of hardware, even like cloud hosted. But I do think people will want to be able

to fire off something that writes tons of lines of code to solve a particular problem, even if it's

something as mundane as like getting you a restaurant reservation at a place that doesn't have a,

you know, an API. Like if there's a restaurant that just has a web form and you basically want to

deploy like agent mode, that might look like writing a web scraper and writing something that

actually does like a headless chromium browser and like clicks it, and that might be

generated from something that looks a lot more like open claw or cloud code than something

Starting point is 00:38:33

that is just a couple lines of Python in a reasoning model. Anyway, there are also a bunch of

nice to haves. These aren't really on the list, but, you know, these apps, they still

occasionally fail to return results when you're in areas with patchy cell phone service.

There's like little UI things. Some of them botched text to speech requests when you will

you'll fire off a deep research report and they'll be like read this to me and then it'll read for

like a minute and then it just stops. Some of the apps don't let you listen to the deep research

reports but they let you listen to the normal reports. So there's all these like little fine

details in the UI that I think are causing more churn and people can just chop away at.

Starting point is 00:39:14

It's unclear if what is required to make an amazing product is just A-B testing all of these things and just optimizing, or is it taste?

I have no idea.

But if you wind up doing, this is my recommendation for anyone who's working on the stuff, if you're just going to run an A-B-test to figure out what is the correct user interface and you run the AP test, you find out that the button should be blue instead of green, don't tell your boss you ran the A-B test.

Tell them it was taste.

Say that it's all about taste.

Good call.

And that you have taste.

It's all about taste.

Starting point is 00:39:48

Because then you'll have a job forever.

Yeah.

But if you say, I'm just the guy who runs A-B test really well.

Probably.

Probably.

Taste is king.

It's true.

The A-I-Models can't taste.

Starting point is 00:39:59

They can't taste A-5 Wagyu.

They can't taste a Cabernet Sauvignon.

Only you can do that.

So make that dinner reservation and enjoy a nice glass of red wine

because the models can't.

They just can't.

There's just no way.

There's no way.

Starting point is 00:40:14

Alpha.

Alpha.

Anyway, let me tell you about MongoDB.

What's the only thing faster than the AI market?

Your business on MongoDB.

Don't just build AI.

Own the data platform that powers it.

And let me also tell you about Lambda.

Starting point is 00:40:28

Lambda is the superintelligence cloud building the AI supercomputers

for training and inference that scale from one GPU to hundreds of thousands.

Robin Hood says historically investing in private markets was limited to institutions

in the elite, but not anymore.

with Robin Hood Ventures, you can now get exposure to private companies like the ones listed below.

They have a new fund that has Databricks, Merckor, Revolut, Air Wallachs, Boom, Supersonic, Ramp, ORA, and Stripe,

which is signed and pending close.

Very curious which of these companies, if any, were actually on board and excited about being part of this lineup.

Starting point is 00:41:10

I think Ramp was. I saw Fax Herbert from Ramp posting about it. And he is...

But that doesn't mean the company...

Okay.

He said, we're excited to partner with Sarah, Shiv, Chan, and the broader Robin Hood Ventures team on their inaugural fund.

On a personal note, I'm revealed. I'm relieved to finally have an answer for family and friends who have been asking,

how do I get exposure to Ramp equity? And so, you know, if this is coming out from your head of investor relations,

It's not exactly a Mac Grimm style response.

So I think most of the companies that are in the press release at least and saying,

Starting point is 00:41:48

hey, you can use our logos are cool.

We'll see where it goes.

There are folks that might get funneled in there and they don't want to be

and there might be a whole bunch of different debates and back and forths.

What is Uncle?

She'll shared kind of some of the cost basis from the prospectus.

They bought Databricks at $150 per share, now trading at 204 ramp at 90, now trading at 98.

Air Wallach's $21.

Starting point is 00:42:21

It's now trading at $18.8, and then Mercor at 714 now trading.

So I've already seen a little uptick.

Anchor came in and was sharing some of his sites, insights friend of the show.

He says a single close-end fund that gives you exposure to some of the top private startups.

My thoughts, people want access to private markets.

Of course, so much wealth creation in America happens in startups

and people desperately want access.

You can see this with the insane silly fees.

Starting point is 00:42:50

People are paying for Anthropics, SpaceX, and Open AI, SPVs.

He says, too, the structure of this fund is broken.

As a closed-end fund, the price here can diverge very significantly

from the net asset value of the underlying assets.

With FOMO from access, this easily traded a very high multiple

to NAV leading to a lot of retail investors

getting their face ripped off.

It ends up being less of a venture fund

Starting point is 00:43:11

versus a speculative product

to ride private market sentiment.

It's a great disclosure.

Long Robin Hood, but we'll not be participating.

Yeah, so we actually have the founder of Destiny

on the show today.

So Hel Prasad.

He's coming on at 1 p.m.

Starting point is 00:43:30

And they're sharing their Q4 results.

They have exposure to anthropic chaos industries,

Hermius, positioning Destiny is in New York stocking.

exchange listed vehicle, democratizing retail access to high-growth.

Yeah, and Destiny has suffered from the same problem.

They were super early.

They got this fund out in almost two years ago, exactly, or close.

And immediately it spiked, right?

Starting point is 00:43:56

There's a lot of demand to get exposure to these assets.

And it's sort of come back down to Earth since then.

But excited to get the update from him and understand.

And let's pull up the rest of the linear lineup to show you who's coming on the show today

because we got Blake Dodge from Pirate Wires, Freddie DeBore, from Substack, So Hill, as we mentioned,

from Destiny, Travis from Mesh Optical, and then Evan Spiegel, the co-founder and CEO, Snap.

Linear, of course, is the system for modern software development.

70% of enterprise workspaces on linear are using agents.

Starting point is 00:44:29

Moving on, Elon Musk announced that XAI is moving away from traditional academic benchmarks

like Humanity's last exam, to focus GROC on maximal utility for real world engineering and software development.

He said, actually, I don't think HLE is a great measure of usefulness for moving away from these benchmarks.

Andy Scott says, so it's bad, question marks.

Who said that?

I think it's totally fair to just focus on real world utility, but, of course, people are still going to ask.

Well, I still want to know how it does.

Yeah, it's interesting.

Starting point is 00:45:07

I mean, Tyler,

give us the update on 4.2 that came out today.

So GROC 4 has already been out.

This is a minor revision.

And 4.1.

So now we're at 4.1.

So now we're at 4.2.

And is it focused on benchmarks,

Starting point is 00:45:25

or have they carved out a particular niche yet?

Yeah.

So I think historically, especially when Grogh 4 come out,

people were like very, very quick to say,

it was like, oh, this is so benchmarks or whatever.

I think they've definitely retreated from that, like, at least, path with 4.2.

It doesn't look, like, outrageously benchmarks or anything.

They did this kind of interesting thing where when you, so it's still not, like, fully out.

Starting point is 00:45:47

It's still, like, in beta, if you go on the GROC, like, interface.

They did this kind of interesting thing where there's, like, four agents.

Okay.

Every time you actually do a prompt, there's, like, four agents.

And the agents specifically have, like, distinct roles.

Okay.

Where it's almost kind of, like, you have four instances of the same model, but they have different system prompts.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:46:06

So you can try to get like, okay, this one is like focused on doing like a qualitative thing.

Instead of mixture of experts, mixture of agents.

Yes, yeah, yeah.

But, you know, mixture of experts is like a, that's like in the architecture of the model.

Within the architecture.

Where this is like, you train the model, then you kind of add this as almost like a harness type thing.

Yes, yes.

So it's kind of an interesting path.

Starting point is 00:46:27

We'll see like, yeah, again, this is still not like the actual 4.2 full, full release.

Okay.

I believe.

Yeah.

But we'll see.

Yeah.

I wonder what the bull case is here for XAI.

There's a world where they carve out some sort of niche, you know,

Starting point is 00:46:43

Anthropics, like focused on coding very specifically and, you know,

had some major, major gains there.

What else is there to be focused on?

I mean, I think with macro hard, they're going very hard on computer use.

Okay, computer use.

Yeah.

See, that would be an interesting thing where they could, like, jump to the front of that.

And if that's the important technology for a couple months,

Starting point is 00:47:03

that could be really good vibes.

Also, it is interesting to think about with the cerebrous news and with the value of high-speed inference on one, the whole model on one chip.

Is that something that Tesla's chip team can iterate towards on a faster time horizon than other chip companies?

I don't really know, but they do custom silicon, and they've done it for a long time, and they got it.

an entire self-driving model that runs on a car. So, you know, they have some experience there.

And they obviously design and fab, or they don't fap it themselves, but they design it themselves.

And so we'll be interesting to see how they carve that out. Let me tell you about Vanta.

Automate compliance and security. Vanta is the leading AI trust management platform.

Starting point is 00:47:56

Let me tell you about Apploven. Profitable advertising made easy with axon.a.

get access to over 1 billion daily active users and grow your business today.

Tariq says I'm proud to share that Humane has invested $3 billion into XAI Series E round

just prior to its historic acquisition by SpaceX.

Through this transaction, Humane became a significant,

a significant minority shareholder in XAI.

The investment builds on our previously announced 500 megawatt AI infrastructure partnership

with XAI in Saudi Arabia,

Starting point is 00:48:26

reinforcing Humane's role as a strategic development partner.

So, yeah, interesting.

Maybe, you know, would have wanted to get this out before the SpaceX acquisition, but better late.

Wait, wait, they said they got in before the acquisition.

I know.

You mean the news?

But, like, you know, this round got announced a while ago.

Yeah.

Starting point is 00:48:52

So maybe they would, they're coming out with this news today.

Yeah, but they're saying, hey, we got in before the acquisition.

So we got SpaceX shares.

Yeah, I don't know.

It is odd that it's delayed.

Better late than ever.

Yeah, you mean on like a comms front.

But like from a financial perspective, like that was the right time to invest, right?

Starting point is 00:49:10

Yeah.

I think that's what's going on.

I wonder why the announcement was delayed.

Maybe it's like regulatory approval.

Yeah.

Because it's an international investment.

Yeah.

Let's play this clip from Jeff Bezos.

Starting point is 00:49:23

His space company, Blue Origin, will move heaven and earth to get to the moon before

rival SpaceX, the CEO Dave Limp said.

Recently, Jeff Bezos, who never tweets, this was his first tweet of 2006, posted a photo

of this like black tortoise, which goes along with blue origins, the motif of slow and ferocious,

methodical.

But a lot of people have viewed it as a warning shot to Elon Musk, which really was focused

on SpaceX going to Mars, and now he's saying we're going to focus on the moon.

What do you make of that tweet and what is the competition right now?

Starting point is 00:50:03

Do you think you're going to be the first?

Well, it gives me an opportunity to put on a T-shirt for you.

So there you go.

Nothing else.

Let me do that.

Do I get to keep this?

Yeah, that's all yours.

And that's the first one off the presses, too, by the way.

Starting point is 00:50:17

I think everybody's going to want one of those.

The T-shirt doesn't have to lose for Blue to succeed.

What the U.S. needs is it needs two SpaceX.

It needs two launch companies that are.

competing vigorously against each other to try to give us the most capabilities as a country

commercially, civilly, from a defense perspective, because our adversaries aren't standing still.

And so we need to be moving very quickly.

Healthy competition.

Starting point is 00:50:44

But I think a lot of people read into that as the tortoise being Blue Origin and the hair

being Elon Musk and SpaceX.

Because it also comes after Secretary Duffy had said that SpaceX is behind.

So they were opening up for everyone in terms of Artemis.

And Jared Isaacman, who's now the administrator, also said, essentially, yeah, whoever can get there first is going to get the contracts.

So do you think you're going to get there first?

I think if asked, we will make it, we'll give it a run for our money.

I like our architecture.

Starting point is 00:51:13

I like our odds of getting there very quickly.

I don't have a crystal ball into what SpaceX is doing.

I think, again, Gwen and Alon are competent, and they show it every day by the last.

launching rockets. But I love the fact that the U.S. would compete us against each other. They are

for sustainability on lunar. We're talking about who could get there in 2028. If asked, we will step

up and we will move heaven and earth to get to the moon first. Move heaven and earth.

Powerful line. The moon race is going to be fun. I think it's shaping up well. I mean,

yeah, a little bit of a come towards in the hair story, a little bit of come from behind. I'm

Starting point is 00:51:55

buying the tortoise as ferocious.

Yeah, I don't love the, I don't really love the analogy.

Like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's the best calm strategy.

Like, I like the vague posting out of Jeff.

It gets, it gets the people going.

But at the same time, just imagining SpaceX as a hair, just like running, running a bunch

of laps around the tortoise, just kind of.

They need to take this way further.

Starting point is 00:52:22

Elon needs to wear tortoise shell glasses.

be like I turned your tortoise into my glasses

and Bezos needs to start carrying a rabbit's foot

for good luck. That would be just a hair.

Like, I got your foot.

You know, I want much more, I want more battles here.

This is great.

Well, let me tell you about OCTA first.

Starting point is 00:52:44

Sorry, Octa helps you assign every AI agent

a trusted identity so you get the power of AI without the risk.

Secure every agent, secure any agent.

According to Calci,

According to Kalshi,

blue origin, will Blue Origin land on the moon before SpaceX?

So if Blue Origin lands an uncrewed moon lander on the moon before SpaceX before January 30, 1, 2030,

the market route will resolve the yes.

Starting point is 00:53:08

So currently it's at a 70% percent.

70%.

So they think the moon race.

Up from 29% in March.

I mean, of course, like the race isn't over.

Like the finish line is not get one lander to the moon.

It's like develop an economy on the moon and get lots of people there.

So, you know, it would just one read on this market, but it is interesting.

Starting point is 00:53:28

And certainly, I mean, you can see the market was not pricing this a year ago, and I don't

think anyone was.

I think everyone thought that Blue Origin was kind of just a side project that was sort of

just like doing space tourism.

And now it seems like they might be going to the moon, which is pretty cool.

We have some breaking news.

What's that?

Claude Oath is officially not allowed an open claw.

Starting point is 00:53:50

So Anthropic is responding to the OpenClaw, OpenAI news.

And Andrew Warner shares that this would be a great time for Sam Altman to step in and let us use OpenAI subscriptions with OpenClawe.

So in the ClaudeCode docs, OOath and OOath authentication, which is used with the free, pro, and max plans,

is intended exclusively for ClaudeCode and clod.aI using Oath tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product tool.

or service, including the agent SDK, is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the

consumer terms of service.

So if you're on the consumer plan, if you're on the consumer plan with Anthropic Claude,

like you just signed up for a normal plan on your app, and then you get excited, you want to

Starting point is 00:54:39

sign up for, you want to set up OpenClaw on your Mac Mini, you do that, and then when you're

in the login flow, you say, hey, I'd look to use my clog tokens over here.

It's going to say, no, you've got to set up an enterprise.

price plan. You've got to set up a proper API, correct?

Yeah. This is not

news, though. This was like a couple weeks ago.

I think like a week after OpenClaug got

like super big, they stopped.

Starting point is 00:54:59

You can still, I mean, I'm pretty sure you can still

use API, like an API key.

An API key? Yeah. And will that

use your consumer plan?

So how it used to be was you could have a clawed

subscription. Okay. And then with

that you get a certain amount of like basically

clawed code tokens. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Starting point is 00:55:16

But they're like massively subsidized.

Okay. It's like 10x. Yeah, yeah.

for the Cloud Code tokens.

Got it.

So they were basically using those in...

In OpenClaw.

Yeah, I guess.

So that was...

Starting point is 00:55:25

In other agents.

Yeah, that was for OpenCode.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Not actually OpenClaw.

Yeah, yeah.

Sorry, I'm getting...

Yeah, no, I know.

But I think it's a similar...

Starting point is 00:55:32

It's 25 different names.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, so...

The chat is saying that this is news that, like,

the particular OpenClaw integration

maybe broke today.

Peter from OpenClaugh has responded and says

Starting point is 00:55:48

that,

open AI has already publicly said that open AI subscriptions will work and continue to work in OpenClaw.

And so it's a little bit odd because, like, yeah, I mean, you can just use the API.

That's not that, like, if you're technical, that's not a problem.

But for the sort of pseudo-technical folks who are setting up OpenClaw instances on their Mac minis,

they might be a lot more encouraged to set up the system if they're able to just log in with Oath.

with their Claude accounts because they're like, yeah, I already have the app and I use the app, and I have some extra tokens.

Why don't I use them over here?

Starting point is 00:56:26

Yeah, Thomas says the news is that they're applying it to the SDK.

Yes.

So there we go.

Anyway, let me tell you about console.

Console builds AI agents that automate 70% of IT, HR, and finance support giving employees instant resolution for access requests and pass-re resets.

Out of the journal.

Yes.

The fossil fuel tycoon teaming up with the Rockefellers to fight energy.

Starting point is 00:56:49

poverty, I'm sure the online conspiracy community.

Well, we love this one.

But we love tycoon.

We're trying to bring the word tycoon back.

So we're having to see the journal using this.

EQT chief executive Toby Rice is starting a nonprofit to tackle a lack of access

to modern energy infrastructure in poor countries.

Toby Rice made his fortune unlocking a gusher of natural gas in Appalachia.

Starting point is 00:57:17

He has a bold new ambition, bringing energy to millions of people.

in impoverished nations, Rice, the chief executive EQT,

one of the largest natural gas producers in the U.S.

is a co-founder of Energy Corps, a nonprofit,

energy corps, a nonprofit that helps developing nations

such as Ghana, Zambia, and Burundi build out their energy infrastructure

and prosper, unlike other philanthropic incentives

that emphasize renewables to energize impoverished societies.

Starting point is 00:57:46

Energy Corps sees a role for a broader

spectrum of solutions from fossil fuels to solar panels and nuclear plants. Notably, this approach

has been endorsed by the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the oldest and richest foundations in the U.S.

They really opened up the floodgates with this. The Rockefellers, you know, wasn't John D. Rockefeller

or the richest person in human history? You see how much he's putting in this project?

200 Gs. 200K. Go solve it. Go solve energy globally. 200K. There you go.

Best I can do is 200 bucks.

I got I'm super excited about this.

Starting point is 00:58:23

I think McCrone deserves a victory lap at this point.

I mean his,

McCrone's size is looking significant.

Yeah, it's size.

It's size compared to this.

No, no.

Obviously, they have a lot of other donors.

The Rockefeller is just a fancy name because Toby and his wife have personally contributed

Starting point is 00:58:40

$3 million.

And the initiative is raising $10 million this year from energy companies, family offices,

and private individuals.

And from his perch,

from his perch at Pittsburgh-based EQT, a company with a market cap of $36 billion.

Toby Rice has preached the benefits of selling more American natural gas across the globe

to reduce emissions and strengthen security of the U.S. and its allies.

Now he's waiting into a debate.

Starting point is 00:59:03

Should impoverish societies be encouraged to rely on polluting fossil fuels to improve their fortunes

or leapfrog to intermittent renewables?

There was this question about, should Brazil be allowed to clear-cut the Amazon rainforest

to pull forward industrialization?

It's the world's lungs. Everyone suffers if that happens, but they would certainly benefit in the short term. So there's a hot debate here, and he is engaging in it. Anyway, let me tell you about Cisco. Critical infrastructure for the AI era. Unlock seamless real-time experiences and new value with Cisco.

David Holtz has hit the timeline. He says 5 million humanoid robots working 24-7 can build Manhattan in six months. Now just imagine what the world looks like when we have 10 billion of them by 2045.

Now imagine the year 2100.

Dyson Sphere.

Starting point is 00:59:52

Dyson Sphere by 2100 is the correct debate.

Like is it before, is it after, but it's like around there.

I keep going back to my land thesis.

It's like when armies of robots can build anything at any time, what is actually scarce.

In this case, I think with 10 billion of them, I don't even think land will be scarce anymore.

It's like, hey, we're making, we're going to build an island.

We're going to build another moon. We're building the moon. New moon alert. There's no,

moon alert. Just build another Earth and just throw it on the other side of the solar system.

Starting point is 01:00:28

Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's, you know, right now we're talking about what businesses are unslawable.

Yeah. The next meta will obviously be uncankable. Unclankable businesses. Are there, what's unclankable? What's

unclancable when you can send, you know, an army robots anywhere. Well, figure out what's unslopable.

We'll figure out what's unclancable and then go invest in it.

The SS discourse. No, no, no. David Holes is like, he's, because David's seen humanoid robots.

He's lived in SF and been around this stuff.

Like he's a true believer.

And he's sort of saying, like, I've seen what they can do.

And I understand the exponential here.

And now imagine 10 billion of them in 100 years.

Like, it's going to be crazy.

And then you have Richard on the other side.

Starting point is 01:01:32

Everything will be blueberries.

I thought you were talking about the delicious tacos post.

He said, I'm the CEO of a hot dog company.

I've worked on hot dogs for 10 years.

and I wasn't prepared for what I've just seen.

Anderil fundraising shows defense tech is still red hot.

Starting point is 01:02:20

Pretty crazy.

80 Ruth, one of the scoop athletes.

Scoop.

There it is.

Scoop.

She says, in case you miss it on Friday, we broke the news at Andrels and talks

at double its valuation to around 60 billion in a new funding round.

So if you were buying triple-layered SPVs in the Anderil at 45, you might.

Starting point is 01:02:39

you might make it, assuming you didn't pay three levels of 10% one-time.

And assuming that the guy you bought them from did abscond and is now in custody of the feds.

That's a bad.

The round is notable for more than just its price, while Anderil technically has both A and I in its name.

It's not the AI-centric type of startup that typically gets all the investor attention in the current cycle.

Very unslappable, right? You're not going to vibe code a drone.

you're not going to vibe code?

Yeah, I don't know.

Starting point is 01:03:10

I think when you think about who's going to unlock the potential of AI for the government,

you think of Palantir, think of Anderol.

No, no, I just mean in terms of like AI disruption.

Like it's not something that you can vibe code a fury drone.

Like that takes a lot of hardware, a lot of testing.

You've got to blow a bunch of stuff up.

You need a test range.

You need government contracts.

Starting point is 01:03:35

Yeah, I just don't.

Yeah, I think, I think all these, you know, defense-oriented businesses, even if they are building software, are quite a bit more insulated just because of the trust factor.

And if Andrew all sells a product for one price and you have a small team coming together saying, you know, we're 10 people, we can build you the same thing for half the cost.

There's not quite as much pricing pressure because the government wants reliability.

They want to set something up and use it for a really long time.

they don't want to really take risks, et cetera, et cetera.

Defense tech's on a tear.

Shield AI, a drone business that can also tap the AI interest,

Starting point is 01:04:14

thanks to its autonomous software,

is in talks to raise a $12 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported,

and several other younger startups will likely raise money

in the next few months.

Paul Kwan, managing director of General Catalyst,

said that part of the reason the firm is so optimistic about defense tech

is because there are very few trillion-dollar markets

that are critical for global resilience,

Starting point is 01:04:36

that are dominated by legacy vendors and which are experiencing both tech and geopolitical

transformation.

Yeah, the number of companies that fall in that bucket is pretty small.

General Catalyst has invested in Anderol as well as other defense-related businesses such

as Serronic and Helsing, a European rival to Anderl.

As the world, unfortunately, braces for more wars.

Increased government spending has led to high prices, high-priced contracts for defense tech.

Kwan said that the U.S. Department is realizing that defense tech is critical.

Starting point is 01:05:06

critical for deterrence.

Kwan said he has been seeing, he has also seen a shift among entrepreneurs, believing that many

of the most talented founders are choosing to build for the defense industrial base.

And you can check out the rest of the story on the information.

A lot of attention's been focused on open router.

If you go on open router and look at the rankings, you can see that Chinese open source

models are completely dominating.

Yes.

Starting point is 01:05:31

Charts.

Minimax.

I saw D.H.

talking about Kimmy K2 is now a daily driver for squashing bugs at 37 signals.

Very interesting data point.

Since a lot of this can be, I think the open router stuff can be a little hard to contextualize

because there's some amount of volume that doesn't get captured in open router, obviously.

It's the majority of the volume is not captured.

Starting point is 01:05:59

You think so?

Yeah, yeah.

According to Zephyr, who's very on it, it's one to two percent globally.

Do you think that's about right?

Yeah, definitely.

I mean, if you just compare, like, the, like, it's, if you look at the actual, like, token count,

it's, like, in the billions for, like, over, you know, a week or something.

Yeah.

Starting point is 01:06:15

Where, you know, I remember Demis, over the summer, he was, like, we're doing, you know,

quadrillion tokens every month or something.

So, like, the scale is completely different.

Quad.

And also, it's, like, no one is going to be using the big labs models on this

because they would just hit the actual API.

It's just easier, right?

So, like, if I'm going to be calling Anthropics,

Starting point is 01:06:34

I'm probably just going to use the Anthropic API.

I'm not going to go through OpenRrador.

So you should expect it to be the open source models

because one of the good things about OpenRrider

is that it has all the different inference providers

together.

So there's a ton of companies that host

the different open models.

Starting point is 01:06:53

So it aggregates them all together.

Yeah. And also, I mean, this doesn't account

for token generation in consumer LLMs.

And that's a huge thing.

Like Google AI Overviews is, I think, the most used LLM product in the world, something like that.

And that's technically generating tokens when you just hit Google search and it answers with an LLM query.

That's token generation.

And then there's stuff that's happening in Gemini app, Claude, app directly, not even coding.

Starting point is 01:07:21

Like no one's using OpenRouter within their consumer app, unless it's like some third-party thing.

But most of them are gone.

Anyway, let me tell you about cognition.

They're the makers of Devin, the AI software engineer,

crush your backlog with your personal AI engineering team.

Let's continue with the timeline.

Jacob Rintamaki has a post here.

He says, unfortunately, it is not seen as cool to say,

Starting point is 01:07:42

but the beatings will continue until more people internalize this.

He's talking about Rune, saying,

I don't think this is a really true,

but it's hard to fight open source copium

because people act like you shot a dog or something.

Because Anton, two years ago, back in December 21st of 2023,

said AGI is more likely to come out of someone's basement, some mega merge Hermes 4,000, than a giant data center.

And I think everyone agrees with this now, but it was very unpopular to say at the time.

Starting point is 01:08:12

I remember John Ludick had a post about open source AI not being like on the critical path to AGI

because of the scaling laws and a whole bunch of other economic factors.

He sort of predicted that meta would stop being so focused on open source because it just doesn't make sense to spend a trillion dollars or a hundred billion dollars on infrastructure that then you capture so little of the value of.

And I think that's why Anthropic has not been very pushing hard on open source.

And even the other superintelligence initiatives, not many of them have been open source.

The open source question has been a very different business model.

But it is very important in terms of a model commoditization and terminal economic equilibriums in the AI lab battle.

Orrin Hoffman is sharing that OZemPEC is bad for business.

Starting point is 01:09:08

A few months ago, someone told me they had heard a rumor that a banker hedge fund had banned its traders from taking OZNic-Wagoe and other GLP-1 weight loss drugs.

The theory, as I understood it, was something like traders need to make quick decisions based on gut instinct and GLP1's mess with your gut instincts.

you're not hungry for snacks, you're not hungry for profits, you lose your edge.

Warren says GLP is getting banned by hedge funds, maybe by sales teams too.

Yeah.

Killing your grind set.

It is funny that doesn't it, isn't GLUCGUCON-like peptide?

Isn't that a peptide that's secreted by the gut?

Starting point is 01:09:43

And so it's like your gut instinct is actually tied to your gut.

Like maybe it's just nominative determinism, but it is funny that those things wound up being worn.

Your gut instincts for some people is saying put on mass.

Scale. It's time to scale.

Time to bulk, bulking seasons here.

Get off the GLP-1s and start levering up, going risk on.

Dr. Cameron Maximus says,

guess what increases drive testosterone, a microdose of terseptitide to cut down on physical

Starting point is 01:10:09

appetite, macrodose of testosterone to amplify psychological appetite.

So the solution is, we're going to ban GLP-1s only if you're taking them solo.

You've got to be taking a full stack.

Did you see bone GPT?

Turns out you really do got to be hungry for it.

It's fantastic.

Claude Sonet 4.6 has improved on benchmarks across the board.

We touched on this yesterday, but particularly outstanding in office tasks,

an agentic financial analysis.

You could see this being baked into

Claude for Excel and a lot of knowledge work.

Lucas Byer over at MSL,

Starting point is 01:11:03

says, formerly Open AI,

says, I usually look at which benches

the small model surpasses to its previous Big Brother.

If it's only a few,

I think that gives a hint as to what they focus on.

Here it is only agentic financial analysis

and office tasks.

It's just a heuristic, of course,

Starting point is 01:11:21

but interesting nonetheless.

And I wonder if,

that's, I wonder if, Tyler, how important is speed between Sonnet and Opus? Is Sonnet consistently faster or just cheaper?

Yeah, I think it's usually faster. It's just a smaller model. Yeah. And then there's Haiku, right, which is a smallest one.

Because I'm wondering if in the coding domain there's a little bit more tolerance for, okay, I've delegated this task, it's going to go cook, and then I'll come back and review the code, review the poll request.

Whereas in finance.

This was the whole thing about Codex, right?

Because Codex was much slower for a while

Starting point is 01:11:58

before Cerebrae.

So people would be like, oh, codex is so bad

compared to Cloud Code.

Even though a lot of people internally at Open Eye

were saying, oh, no, actually Codex is way better.

It's just because they're used to having

the internal model that's run on the better hardware.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Starting point is 01:12:11

So I think speed is actually, it plays a very large role.

So even if you have a smaller model,

it's much faster.

Even if it's a little bit worse,

I think there's still a lot of, like,

if you're iterating a lot,

it can actually be much more efficient.

I'm just thinking, like, in terms of, like, an Excel co-pilot

Starting point is 01:12:28

for someone who's spending their time in Excel, not in GitHub,

will speed be a killer feature for them if they're currently like,

yeah, I've tried it, but it's really slow.

It actually slows me down, because it takes 20 minutes to respond.

It gets it 80% of the way there, but I can do 90% in 15 minutes.

So I'm not using that model yet.

I'm not excited about that.

Maybe this is something that speeds things up.

Starting point is 01:12:53

course there's ways to just inference them all faster even even the big guys yeah i mean i think um when a lot of

the agenic browsers first came out uh one of the like benchmarks i would i would use is like editing a

spreadsheet yeah sheets and it was so slow that it was like it was like it was working but it's just so

unbearably slow there's like literally no point of using it yep so i think yeah speed is like

John.

says what is going on at Anthropic. They're going after people with multiple paid max

accounts. You're paying full price multiple times and they're treating you like a criminal.

Not sure what Dario is trying to speed run here. And on Reddit, on Claude code, it says

Claude just banned having multiple max accounts since around a few hours ago, signing into

another account has stopped working. I think some people do need to have their multiple max accounts

banned. They're just, they're not building anything useful. They're wasting tokens and they're just

Starting point is 01:14:23

creating endless, endless setups and tool chains and MD files. And unless you're actually shipping

something that's going to drive business value and be used by more than one person, you only get

one account. I'm with, I'm with a clot on this. Stop wasting tokens on your silly thing. I was reflecting

on like, like the, I was texting you this last night, like, like, am I dumb?

and out of ideas or is all the software I want just illegal?

Because I was like, all the things that I want are things that could exist,

but they can't exist for business reasons.

Yeah, like I want an Apple TV app.

Starting point is 01:15:01

Give the example.

So the example was, I want an Apple TV app that has Netflix installed.

It's like, why doesn't Netflix integrate with Apple TV?

Because Netflix doesn't want to get aggregated.

They're an aggregator.

They want you to open that app on the Apple TV.

So the Apple TV app doesn't have Netflix content, even though you have the Netflix app

installed on Apple TV the device. And I was saying, like, I subscribe to all these different news

Starting point is 01:15:24

sources. I want, like, an Apple news that aggregates them all, Google Reader that aggregates

them all. I pay, but I'm still logged out of million things. Like, I'm in some social app,

and then it opens in a Safari web browser. I'm not logged in. There's a paywall. It's annoying

to log back in. I want something that just, like, aggregates all my news sources and jumps the

paywall. Well, that's not a coding issue. That's like a business.

business issue. They want you to log in for a reason and they have a decision to that.

So I don't know. I think we're still early in the broad like distribution of people building custom

software and experimenting with things. But at the same time, like we've had great writing models

Starting point is 01:16:04

for a long time and anyone we know, everyone could write their own books. Everyone could write a

better ending to the end of Game of Thrones and send it to you as a text file right now with the current

models, and I haven't read anything that I've been like, oh, yeah, this is really good.

I got to read this AI generated book. So I don't know. There's like some weird bottleneck there

that it's like, it's not, it's not a bear case for AI. Look what Gabe is offering.

Yeah. It sounds very illegal. Yeah. This is popcorn TV. It's called U-Torrent. I know, I know, I know.

X-Bodern. Trying to play by the rules.

Xbox Media Center. But that's the thing is that, is that, yes, that streaming site, like, yes,

Starting point is 01:16:43

You can vibe code that.

But that can't actually get to scale.

It can't actually have an impact in the economy

because it's breaking the rules.

And there's a lot of AI stuff

that feels magical.

And you see this with C-Dance from By-Dance,

I love that headline.

On Twitter, it's all,

C-Dance just destroyed V-O-3 and Sora too.

But in the journal,

It's TikTok's Chinese parent develops movie app.

And there's something interesting here.

So Singapore is where it's based.

Starting point is 01:17:19

Singapore.

The company behind TikTok has developed an artificial intelligence model

that can turn a single text prompt

into a high-quality video with a storyline, scene changes,

and distinctive characters.

The new AI video creation model from Beijing-based Bight Dance

is generating buzz in China and backlash in Hollywood

over copyright issues.

Starting point is 01:17:38

It shows how BightDance, known for creating TikTok,

is emerging as a rival to open AI in alphabet

Google in the race to build tools for making AI movies and other video entertainment.

China's visual models have been very, very competitive, said Steve Long, a video game developer

in Helsinki, who participated in beta testing programs.

Bight Dance recently ceded control of the U.S. version of TikTok to an investor group.

But for now, it doesn't

seem like it's been fully solved.

But this was the interesting paragraph

that I wanted to highlight in this journal article.

Starting point is 01:18:32

Global users of another BightDance app

Capcut, a popular video

creation and

an editing app, will soon have access

to C-Dance 2.

its latest AI model for creating videos.

The company said, the model is already available to users on Capcut's Chinese version.

And so, I mean, you've seen on Instagram Reels, like there are a ton of Capcut editors out there.

Starting point is 01:18:54

I get served, you know, how to edit in Capcut, and I don't even really use the app.

But it's clearly incredibly powerful.

There's a whole bunch of cool features in Capcut that would basically be After Effects plugins

and would probably take a long time to configure, but just come out of the box and it's just a couple clicks.

So you don't have to know any code or install anything.

It's just there.

you're going to be able to generate C-Dance videos.

We'll see how long you can still generate Larry David and Marvel characters.

Starting point is 01:19:18

That stuff will probably get pulled back on eventually, at least in the CapCat American version.

But you're going to see a lot more slop in the trough.

Dean Ball

is... Before we do this, let me tell you about

phantom cash. Fund your wallet without

exchanges or middlemen and spend

with the phantom card. Dean Ball says

if the Department of War and Anthropic can't agree

Starting point is 01:19:56

on terms of business and they should do business together.

I have no problem with that, but a mere contract

cancellation is not what is being threatened by

the government. Instead, it is something

broader designation of Anthropic

as a supply chain risk. This is normally

applied to foreign adversary

technology like Huawei.

Starting point is 01:20:11

In practice, this would require all Department of Work contractors to ensure there's no use of anthropic models involved in the production of anything they offer to DOW.

Every startup and every Fortune 500 company alike.

This designation seems quite escalatory, carrying numerous unintended consequences, and doing potential significant damage to U.S. interest in the long run.

I hope the two organizations can work out a mutually agreeable deal.

If they can, I hope they agree to peaceably part ways.

But this really needn't be a holy war. Anthropic is in Google in 2018. They've always cared about national security use of AI. They were the most enthusiastic AI lab to offer their products to the national security apparatus. If Anthropic run by Democrats whose political messaging is anthropic run by Democrats, whose political messaging sometimes drives me crazy, sure, but that doesn't mean it's wise to try to destroy their business. This admin believes AI is the defining technology competition of our time. I don't see how tearing down one of the most advanced and innovative AI.

startups in America, helps America win that competition. It seems like it would straightforwardly do the

opposite. The supply chain risk designation is not a necessary move. Cheaper options are on the table.

Starting point is 01:21:21

If no deal is possible, cancel a contract and leverage America's robustly competitive AI market

to give business to one or more of Anthropics several fierce competitors. And there was also

reporting this morning that Anthropic had approached 1789 Capital.

Chris Busker. He's been. And Don Jr.

And they turn them down.

Turn them down.

They turned down from 1789.

They said not interested in because of biological reasons.

Starting point is 01:21:51

I think I know a little bit about why there might be so much pushback against Anthropic.

And I mean, you saw that the Sonnet 4.5, people were really excited about this model,

but it completely fell flat on its face when asked with a basic question,

why did clavicular get frame-mogged?

And Sonnet 4.5 responded, I'm not familiar with clavicular.

as a specified person or entity, or what frame-mogged means in this context?

Could you provide some more context?

So it's just like when you see something like that happen, it calls into question everything

Starting point is 01:22:23

about a company.

It's just like, how could you let this happen with so little worldly knowledge

as to not understand the significance of colliculars frame-mogging?

Anyway, overheard in SF, a VC was giving advice.

Open AI and Anthropic are like Godzilla.

You need to find an alleyway to hide in.

What a funny thing to say.

He says, don't take advice from junior VCs.

There's something good there.

I mean, the models, you know, if you're in the path of models improving, you will get stomped like Godzilla.

But there's still plenty of opportunities all over the ecosystem, especially if you're not doing something that's in soft.

I'd be like, you know, like, there's plenty of startups that's just like, don't touch software.

Just don't do anything with code.

Just don't do anything with technology.

Don't do it, don't do anything with a website.

Starting point is 01:23:22

Don't do anything with the website.

things to build.

Bucco says $2 trillion in capex for this, by the way, kind of like saying, like, it's silly,

but I look at this and think.

It's worth every penny.

Completely worth it.

Even if the $2 trillion just created this one video.

Yeah.

We're entering the post-slop era.

Back to TasteGate.

Young Macro.

Just chiming in on TasteGate.

Is taste valuable?

I don't know.

I can't tell.

But maybe it is.

Starting point is 01:25:11

Some people say it is.

I'm not really going to weigh in, but young macros weighing in. He says, many will not want to hear this, but taste is just G, intelligence, with sufficiently varied training data. Steve Jobs had taste because he was like plus three standard deviation IQ and trained on calligraphy class and being homeless, smoking weed in India or whatever. Meanwhile, his IQ match now, microdoses amphetamines to narrow the training set and ends up drone maxing at Citadel Securities with a great training.

transcript. Sorry, Chud, the flunker will get the cake this time. There is something interesting

there. Just the idea of like varied wild life experiences being valuable to generate, you know,

it's not exactly out of distribution training data, but just, oh, life well lived will translate

into innovation and taste or just like new ideas as opposed to being tracked and funneled into

Citadel Securities. Yeah, so it worked. I haven't, I haven't. I haven't. I,

I haven't really waited into the taste debate at all,

Starting point is 01:26:16

just because it's not everyone's trying to define it

in their own way.

It's something that in some ways, you people like to say,

oh, you can't buy it.

You can't buy it in the fullness of a company,

because I think, like, taste comes from the founder

or the founders, and it just kind of like, you know,

percolates through the organization indefinitely.

Starting point is 01:26:39

Like, there's companies that have a billion dollars

to spend on marketing that just functionally can never be good at marketing because the founder

likes to be heavily involved in marketing and they don't have great marketing taste or instinct

or whatever this thing is. But it just feels like everyone's, I don't know, I'm for taste,

I'm against taste. I have like, you know, it. Fun fact, if you hold your nose, you can't taste

as well. So if you're trying to be tasteful, don't hold your nose. Well, COVID. And that,

COVID wiped out a lot of people's...

Oh, yeah, they lost their smell.

Starting point is 01:27:15

Palliser Capital sent a letter to the board of Toto last week to make more of its advanced ceramic segment saying it holds a crucial position in the semiconductor supply chain.

segment generates 40% of Toto's operating profit.

Sounds like an insane headline, but we should dig in.

No, it actually maybe sort of makes sense if you need ceramics in the semiconductor supply chain.

I wonder if the funniest outcome here is, you know how like we can't get PS6s anymore.

PlayStation's are out of stock.

So that's where we're at.

Starting point is 01:31:29

That's where we're at.

But, well, we are at the point in the show where we will bring in our first guest, Blake Dodge from PirateWire's.

you can go and subscribe at piratewires.com. Blake, welcome to the show. How are you doing?

It's happening.

Hi, I'm great. How are you guys? We're fantastic. What has been keeping you? Well, first,

introduce yourself since it's the first time on the show. I'd love a little bit of your

background and then some of what you've been focusing on at Pirate Wires recently.

Yeah, totally. So I basically started my career as a journalist at Business Insider.

Starting point is 01:32:03

Oh, cool. I covered healthcare and then technology.

I was doing like big scary investigations with a lot of documents and you know secret sources and stuff.

And I got a little bit not burned out maybe a little bit burned.

I wanted to tell more optimistic stories about what was going on in tech.

And so that's why I joined pirate wires about a year ago.

where I've done a lot of that work kind of like the white pill case for why you should believe in someone.

But then we also do we do a lot of work that I think centers original thought and maybe the kind of in the spirit of the contrarian.

We'll look at an issue, what everyone else is saying and then kind of tell people actually, but actually this is what you should.

Starting point is 01:33:03

think.

Truth.

Yeah.

And so lately we've been doing a lot of that with the proposed wealth tax in California.

We've kind of flooded the zone there and been duking it out actually with the New York Times

and the Wash Street Journal.

So I kind of feel like I'm back at B.I.

all of a sudden.

Starting point is 01:33:22

Yeah, exactly.

Well, yeah, what has been the response?

I mean, you've interviewed a ton of billionaires in California.

It feels like the base case is just like everyone leaves.

Like maybe they're not all loud about it, but, you know, Mark Zuckerberg's not out there,

but like he did buy a place in Miami, and it seems like he might be a Miami resident soon.

Yeah, there's kind of two waves.

There's people that were like, I'm going to get out in 2025, so I never have to pay the tax.

Starting point is 01:33:47

And there's a second wave, which I think is the Mark Zuckerbergs that are like,

I, like, if this goes through, it'll get fought.

I might not have to pay it, but then I'm still kind of like, you know, potentially hedging and getting out.

And so I think there's, again, this is, we're kind of in the midst of the second wave of people that are like, I might have to pay it once, but I'm certainly not going to pay it every year for the rest of my life.

Yeah, yeah.

A couple weeks ago, Mike Salana published a piece where he interviewed more than 20 billionaires in the state of California, which is like, wow.

Might make him the most well-sourced tech journalist ever, but they literally all said that they were leaving or planned to leave.

So that's really striking.

Starting point is 01:34:35

That's like a meaningful percentage of the total billionaires in California.

And what's really interesting is they're not.

They may be leaving because they don't want to pay the tax.

But actually, the tax is retroactive.

So many of them, many of the folks who are leaving probably will still have to pay it if it goes through.

But they're leaving anyway because of the kind of overarching.

political landscape of California.

Like they're just kind of over it.

Starting point is 01:35:08

And they find the kind of lefty politics to be too risky,

not only to build wealth, but to build companies.

There's language in the proposed ballot measure

that has really thrown people through a loop where...

So the government has this challenge of tallying people's net worth,

you know, which is not easy.

When it comes to founders of private companies,

they're using kind of a shortcut

Starting point is 01:35:39

where founders will be presumed

to be owners of anything they control.

You guys have probably seen the scary math with this

on your timelines,

but basically since founders often have,

their shares often come with outsized voting rights,

what this means is you could be,

presumed to be an owner of 10 times the value of your actual economic position.

Starting point is 01:36:09

And that's all subject to a rebuttal process and stuff.

It's not supposedly meant to be the final word.

But I think founders hear that and it's like, okay, like this is a significant risk to the business and to my longevity in the state.

How are you thinking about the probability that this actually passes?

It feels like something that would be broadly popular amongst a direct,

in a direct democracy scenario.

I saw some protests that did not seem very widely attended.

And so it doesn't,

Starting point is 01:36:48

it seems like it's hard to marshal 50 million people or 10 million people that are against this

because it's not a tax that affects everyone.

Yeah, yeah, the pro-billionaire protest for some reason was not well attended in San Francisco.

I have no idea why.

Certainly not by billionaires.

Yeah, it's like Gary Tan with like one sign.

Did Gary go?

I don't think you went.

Starting point is 01:37:17

I actually don't think you went.

Yeah, so the politics on the other side are a bit better because the headline of this whole saying is,

let's tax billionaires 5% of their net worth one time for this like you know emergency of paying for

health care for poor people and so for Medicaid yeah and so I think that does have a

certain political appeal if it does make it on the ballot we're sort of hearing like mixed

reviews on its chances.

Mike did some reporting

that went out

Starting point is 01:37:58

just today, actually, that suggests

their signature gathering,

maybe a little bit behind.

And then you have a

ton of opposition in state, like

Gavin Newsom hates this thing.

He's been meeting with Dave Reagan, the head

of the union, who sponsored the ballot

Starting point is 01:38:15

measure to try and get him to stop.

There's also

like teachers unions and kind of some

surprising adversaries. Well, yeah, there's other unions that are like, hey, you're trying to,

you're trying to get this tax for purely your own benefit. Like, you've got to cut us in. So it's like

the unions, even if they might have been in favor of it, if they were going to get a piece of it,

there's quite a number of groups that are just saying, like, I don't want this to happen if I'm not

getting more. Right. Is that, is that like actually, that is kind of how it works. Yeah. Because the unions in

Starting point is 01:38:50

different special interests use the ballot proposition process to raise money, like to,

to get more funding streams.

And Mike learned specifically that the teachers union is feeling kind of left out in this

particular scenario.

How is Reagan reacted to everyone leaving?

Are they processing this?

because, you know, play this out.

Yeah, you have a number in mind.

Starting point is 01:39:23

You're like, I'm getting 5% of 60 people's wealth,

and that's probably like a couple billion dollars.

And then there's only, and then 20 leave,

and you're like, now I'm getting like $3 billion.

And then another $20 leaving, you're like, now I'm getting $1 billion.

Yeah, there's also an insane power law.

Yeah, right.

Oh, yeah, sure.

Starting point is 01:39:38

So the biggest ones leave, of course.

The people that stay might be the poorest billion.

The guy who's at 1.2 is like,

I guess I'm good for my 20 mil.

You can take it.

Yeah, I mean, so far, the folks behind the ballot measure have not acknowledged that people are actually, in fact, leaving.

They continue to call wealth, like, largely a myth, which is crazy.

We'll be talking these people on Twitter, like, we literally spoke to 20 of them.

Starting point is 01:40:10

They literally are leaving the state.

It's not a myth.

but they point to research mainly looking at the movement of millionaires and just generally

wealthy people after taxes are increased.

And it's true that in those cases there's not a lot of mobility, but I think they have made the mistake

that the two employers are the same.

Yeah, is part of the strategy that this is the best possible branding for a tax like this

and this type of like campaign focused on billionaires one time is how you get something like this past.

Starting point is 01:40:49

Then once it's passed, you'll have the ability to kind of like reduce the set of requirements to qualify for it.

And you can eventually get down and be eating off of the plate of all Californians, middle class, et cetera.

Yeah, I'm actually, I'm staring at a quote that I have here in my last story.

There's a couple of academics whose work, like, heavily influenced this wealth tax and pretty much all wealth taxes globally.

One of those men is advocating for a 2% globally coordinated billionaire tax where all of the countries kind of get together and agree they're going to do this.

Sort of like a one-world government.

I literally, in this quote, have a screenshot of Michael Gibson's.

summary of Fetil

Starting point is 01:41:43

Antichrist lectures.

So yeah, he says

it's clearly far from enough

but also what history shows

is that what's most difficult is to move

from zero to something positive.

And once you have something positive

even if it's 2%,

Starting point is 01:41:59

then it opens up a realm of possibilities.

And so they say

it's one time, they say it's an emergency,

but clearly

what

what's the takeaway from the

Netherlands, they pass this 36% unrealized capital gains tax. It excludes, I think, real estate and

startup equity. But what's the thought process there? It seems super bearish for the country as a whole.

Starting point is 01:42:30

But any learnings? I haven't looked at that one specifically. I know that internationally,

these wealth taxes do have a pretty dismal.

outlook. The cycle is kind of... It's very American to be like, ah, we can make it work.

We're built everywhere else, but it'll work here. Yeah, and it's funny, too, the, the,

they're still saying wealth flight is a myth, but part of why these other wealth taxes tend to go

poorly is because the wealth leaves. So, can you give us a white pill something that,

I don't think, from a comms perspective, don't tax. Don't tax.

me is going to be effective for the billionaire class. But what should they be focused on in a world

Starting point is 01:43:18

where a lot of people are seeing billions of dollars in wealth creation from what they see a slop,

what they see as scams, what they see as, you know, a variety of, you know, water usage,

energy price, blah, blah, blah, blah. What are the white pills that you think tech has delivered

or is in the process of delivering over the past few years and into the future?

Yeah, I mean, that's the question of the hour because inequality isn't, you know, continues to get worse and kind of fuels the politics behind these things.

I'm kind of a gundo stand.

Like, I believe in this patriotic vision for tech.

Yeah.

Starting point is 01:44:05

And this idea of keeping regular people in mind and building.

businesses that last and create value and don't just kind of

addict people to things that they shouldn't be doing or shouldn't be spending their money on.

And I think, you know, who knows what billionaires could do.

Like, there's a lot of ideas out there.

Mike Salana actually just wrote a Christmas wish list for billionaires with like 20 of these really beautiful white pill ideas.

One of the easiest things is, you know, building like,

beautiful public works, libraries, statues, like things that people can see with their own eyes

Starting point is 01:44:48

and feel gratitude about. Whereas right now I feel like...

Yeah, it's not that compelling to be like, don't hate me. I built this short format.

Instead of like the public library, it has the Rockefeller name on it or something. Like there's a

lot of examples as you walk through New York City where you see a beautiful building and you're like,

oh yeah, and that's free to the public now. I'm a big fan of like the

Hearst Castle, like William Randolph Hurst, like, just built this castle for his entire life,

spent all his money, died before it was even done, and then it just becomes like public good.

Or even in California, the like really ramping up something like an adopta highway program,

Starting point is 01:45:26

like driving around L.A., the roads are just so, so, so bad.

Yeah. But the tangible, yeah, the tangible thing that you can see is very, very, it's very impactful

as opposed to like the anonymous donation that just kind of works its way through.

the economy.

It might be more impactful, but certainly less grounded in reality.

Anyway, where can people find you?

Sign up for PirateWires, follow you on Axe.

Where else are you active?

Starting point is 01:45:55

Yeah, yeah, I'm on X at Dodge Blake, PirateWires.com.

We're covering all this stuff every week.

We've really flooded the zone.

And yeah, and I feel like, too, we're pro-tech in this.

sense of not being anti.

But we also tend to ground things in a set of values, which I think is a little, well,

I love it personally.

I'm glad.

Starting point is 01:46:23

That's fantastic.

Well, thank you so much for taking the time to come chat with us.

And we will talk to you soon.

Goodbye.

Cheers.

Let me tell you about Railway.

Railway is the all-in-one intelligent cloud provider.

Use your favorite agent to deploy apps, servers, databases, and more.

Starting point is 01:46:38

while railway automatically takes care of scaling, monitoring, and security.

And with that, we will kick off the Lambda Lightning Round because we have Freddie DeBarr from

Substack.

He's an independent writer.

We're bringing Freddie into the TVPN Ultradown from the Restream later in.

Freddie, how you doing?

Pretty good, although, you know, from Substack still never sounds as cool as like the Wall

Street Journal or whatever.

Starting point is 01:47:05

Whatever anybody says about, like, independent media, it's just never going to catch up.

but that's okay.

Yeah, I don't know.

From social media.

Do you think subsection should do a bundle?

Do you think subtext should do a bundle?

This is a big debate.

The thing is, it's like the same question about like,

Starting point is 01:47:20

why can't I just pay a dollar for the New York Times article I want?

Because the reason why is like the finances just don't work out.

Like if I would love to be able to do that from a standpoint of like getting people to

read my stuff, but my financial life would collapse.

Like it's getting that,

regular income and that sort of makes this possible.

Yeah, I think my view on it is I think the, like a, a bundle that is just a, is systematized via a platform is going to struggle.

But a bundle that, where you get four or five writers that just basically say, we're going to build a media company together, that can work.

Starting point is 01:47:59

Yeah.

Because there's just so many other small things you need to do around compensation and what's fair and who's doing what and all these different things that I think are,

when you have a bunch of personalities coming together,

it's hard to just have it be entirely in code.

Anyway, let's move on.

The problem is that eventually, if you bundle enough people,

you just have a newspaper,

and I probably wouldn't get into the newspaper business

Starting point is 01:48:22

in the 21st century.

I love newspapers, though.

I got it right here.

I'm not investing in one, though.

No, no, I think it's the time,

the days are numbered.

I might be the last person subscribing.

Anyway, give us a little bit of your background since the first time of the show.

Starting point is 01:48:40

How did you get to, Substack?

And then I want to talk about your wager and the future of AI, the impact on the economy, all of that.

Yeah, so I mean, I'm a writer.

I was an academic.

I was in academia for years.

I used to work for the City University of New York.

But now, frankly, I find not having a boss or a schedule or ever having to get up in

a particular day to be very attractive.

Starting point is 01:49:09

And now I just write books and I write my substack.

And, you know, it's enabled me to buy a house.

And, you know, so it's, you know, it's a pretty good living.

That's great.

So tell me about your wager.

How did this happen?

What is, how did you come to define the, the actual bet and what's at stake?

Yeah.

Starting point is 01:49:28

So I, I'm frustrated by the AI conversation.

I think that it is, I don't know if.

if you guys are familiar with a concept of a Motten Bailey argument.

Yes.

A Motten Bailey.

Yeah, for those at home, it's just like you are, you make a very sort of extravagant argument.

And when challenged, you retreat to a simpler and easier to defend argument.

So you might say, the Christian God is real and built the universe and he rules over everything.

Starting point is 01:49:57

And then when you're challenged, you say, oh, well, God's just a feeling and God's in the wind and whatever.

That's like a Motten Bailey.

I just think that that's all over AI where.

The CEO of Google is saying that this is bigger than fire and electricity.

And people are saying it's going to end death, et cetera.

But then when challenged, it's like, hey, you know, these LLMs, like, you know, they might make, like going through legal documents, you know, of much more efficient processes.

There's this constant sort of back and forth.

As far as the wager goes, the people in the AI world kind of come from this sort of rationalist CIA, a Silicon Valley, sort of.

Starting point is 01:50:35

of culture, and they say you should be very sort of objective and specific in your predictions,

and you should put money on them.

And so Scott Alexander is a guy I've known for a long time, the blogger of Slate Star Codex

and now Vastral Codex 10.

He is a AI enthusiast.

He was a signatory on the AI 2027 document.

So I just challenged Scott and said, I believe that three years from now will be in a more

or less normal economy.

Starting point is 01:51:04

And that was chosen because, you know, AI 2027, you know, this is like going to

2029, so I felt like it was giving him enough sort of wiggle room.

And I just defined a bunch of economic indicators and said that if any one of these

indicators are violated, he'll win the bet and I'll lose.

And the reason to do that is just I'm looking for someone to put their money where their

mouth is about, like, is this actually going to cause a white collar apocalypse and all these

economic sort of things. And I mean, he said no and would prefer to do a 10-year version. So we're

kind of looking at that right now. Okay. So I have some of these. Unemployment must stay under 18%.

Starting point is 01:51:44

Right. What are we at now? Four or five percent? That feels like... But see, but this is the point.

Yes. This is the Maun Bailey, right? Dario Amade, the CEO of Anthropic, last week in an interview

with the New York Times said that within the next couple of years, 50% of all jobs are going to be

destroyed.

Is it 50% of all jobs?

I thought it was early stage white collar labor.

No, no, no, no.

Look it up.

Starting point is 01:52:11

He's losing it up.

He's losing it.

50% of all the jobs in the economy are going to be eliminated, right?

And this is the thing that bothers me.

This is why I made the bet.

Because I ran, yeah, I actually ran the numbers on the new argument, the Bailey, which is

entry-level white-collar work.

I mean, the U.S. economy is only 60% white collar, early-stage.

Starting point is 01:52:28

is a couple percent of that. And so you're at a percentage of a percentage and quickly,

if you lose 50 percent of that, the unemployment rate goes from 5 percent to 8 percent, 9 percent.

Like that statement, that new statement can be true, but it can not be, it can simultaneously be

not that disastrous. Right. So the C, not the CEO, but the, the head of AI science at Microsoft

just made a very similar sort of pronouncement. Sure. And this is what I find just endlessly

frustrating about this conversation is it cannot simultaneously be true that we are imminently facing

a replacement of an immense number of jobs in the economy thanks to AI but also 18% is like a

extravagant figure for me to set for this bet right if you if you really believe these things and so

Starting point is 01:53:20

I I'm just never sure how seriously these AI people take it in part because the the CEO

of Anthropic and the head of AI at Microsoft and almost everyone else who gets quoted in this domain has a direct financial incentive to exaggerate the impact of AI.

Yeah, I mean, Scott Alexander did take the bet, though. So he's putting his money where his mouth is and is certainly on the other side of this, correct?

Well, we are looking at the conditions. He wants to do 10 years instead of three.

Oh, interesting.

And so it's actually turned into a kind of an interesting econometric debate, right?

So people are saying, where did you get 18% unemployment for?

And there's something like 40 conditions I listed.

Starting point is 01:54:06

Yeah, yeah, there's a ton here.

And I said that we had 15% unemployment, you know, five and a half years ago.

Yeah.

Right?

Because of COVID.

Yeah.

And what I'm trying to do is to set up the bet in such a way that a non-AI source is not going to screw me, right?

You know?

Starting point is 01:54:24

Oh, sure.

In the Great Depression, which obviously was not AI-driven, we had 28% unemployment at some point, right?

So, and it's actually led to a kind of interesting debate about, like, how do you define a normal economy without letting the natural swings that are common to a capitalist economy?

Yeah, I was listening to a, I was listening to a conversation about AI apocalypses and the person that was being interviewed was like, well, my P-Dume from AI is extremely low, but,

I think the chance of nuclear war is like 5%.

It's like they had a high P-dum, but not because of AI,

which is like a very hard thing to wrestle with.

And that's what you're getting at.

Starting point is 01:55:04

Yeah, I've talked on the show a bunch about a bunch of these different groups

using basically fear as a kind of motivator to get the, to kind of bend the world.

So if you want people to adopt AI, you should tell them that it's going to, you know,

create such such insane changes in the economy that any company that doesn't adopt as much AI as possible today is going to be destroyed or if you are trying to get you know as many young people to adopt a product you tell them well like all jobs are going to be wiped out or if you're pitching a bunch of if you're pitching investors on Wall Street you can say well you know all these jobs are going to go away so like it's effectively like the the the in the

incentive to use kind of like fear is very obvious in all of this. And I think it's now coming back

to bite a lot of these people because the broader populace is saying, I don't want A-A-A-I'm good.

I don't need it. Even though they're using the products and they love them. Like almost everyone

can tell you an incredible story about AI in their personal life. Like even if it's as simple as like,

Starting point is 01:56:21

I made this like cool illustration for, you know,

my grandma for her birthday and she loved it, right?

Or I used it to learn about this thing.

And so I think it's interesting is like using this like intense fear based marketing to justify,

to kind of catalyze adoption, you know, fun, you know, success with fundraising, et cetera.

But then again, it's kind of coming back to bite in the sense that everyone's saying,

well, no, I don't want a data center in my backyard.

I don't, I don't want my company to even be investing in this, et cetera.

Starting point is 01:56:55

I mean, speaking of fear, I mean, you just mentioned nuclear war, right?

And it's, I just think that you can believe, as I do, that AI is going to be a very meaningful technology.

But the fact that people are more scared of a robot apocalypse than nuclear war, look, right now, Russia has multiple Boré-class nuclear submarines off the coast of the East Coast of America that have the capability of raining nuclear.

of raining nuclear fire down, thermonuclear fire down,

all up and down the seaboard, right?

The eastern seaboard.

I mean, like, you know,

a single modern thermonuclear bomb detonated above Central Park

Starting point is 01:57:35

would destroy 80 plus percent of the buildings in Manhattan

and hit parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, etc.

Right?

And again, this is the Martin Bailey thing, right?

Which is like, you might say, well, that's a very extreme scenario.

But every day, I am opening up my web browser

in reading about, oh, AI is going to exterminate the human race, or, you know, AI is going to put us

into this utopia where no one is ever going to die again, right? And it's like, part of what I'm

Starting point is 01:58:05

trying to do is just claw out like a normal space in this, right? To just say, there is a very

obvious future where these tools are meaningful, eliminate some jobs, are, have a lot of cultural

importance, but where we're not suddenly faced with a fundamentally different version of human

life. So if it's not nuclear war and it's not fire and it's not electricity, it's also not the

fax machine? Are we talking about mobile, cloud, the internet? Like how big is this thing? What does

your world model look like for how AI progresses and diffuses through society? Sure. We have to understand

there's are different kinds of importance and different kinds of influence.

So you've mentioned the Internet and the mobile phone, okay?

Starting point is 01:58:57

Obviously, the Internet and specifically the smartphone, the iPhone, have had massive cultural

and social impacts on the United States.

It would have shocked people in the bid 1990s to learn that we have about the same productivity

growth and about the same GDP growth in this country now that we did back then, right?

Like many, many people were at it.

invested in this idea that this sort of this missing GDP growth, you know, we're at half of

what we were in the mid-1960s, a lot of people thought, okay, the internet's the thing that's

going to restore us.

Starting point is 01:59:30

The internet is very meaningful and it's very influential, right?

And yet economically, it hasn't had the effects that are expected.

And that's just like, that's how history works.

You know, that's just like there's, there is a, you always have to bake into percentage

to the degree to which, like, there's regression to the means.

Right. Like we always seem to find ourselves back to this sort of mundane reality. And I look at things like when everybody got so depressed and disappointed after chat GPT5 was released because they thought it was going to be AGI. And you had all of these lonely guys who were like, oh, this is just going to change life forever. And now everything is going to change. It's like, no, it's things are going to change, but slowly and in a distributed fashion. And you have to keep planning for normal life.

Counterpoint, maybe this time's different.

Maybe this time is different, but absolutely.

Starting point is 02:00:24

So show me.

I mean, here's the beauty of all this.

The beauty of all of this is like, if the real stuff happens, you're not going to have to convince me.

Right.

Like if we really have AGI the way people think we are, no one's going to disagree because the effects are going to be so profound.

There's going to be nothing to disagree about.

Okay.

How did you interpret this latest piece?

Starting point is 02:00:45

piece in the Financial Times from Eric Brian Falson, I can't pronounce his last name, but it says,

while initial reports suggested a year of steady labor expansion in the United States,

the new figures reveal that total payroll growth was revised downward by approximately 400,000

jobs. Crucially, this downward revision occurred while real GDP remained robust, including

a 3.7% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This decoupling, maintaining high output with

significantly lower labor input is the hallmark of productivity growth. His own updated analysis

suggests a U.S. productivity increase of 2.7% for 2025. This is nearly doubling from the sluggish

1.4% annual average that characterized the past decade. It feels like we're seeing glimmers of

Starting point is 02:01:35

something changing. Is that not a sign? I mean, we'll see, right? We have to actually look at the

at the numbers as they come down the pike,

we also have to be aware that, like,

there's a lot of built-in incentive

for people to ascribe these changes to AI.

So, for example,

cutting a lot of jobs is very unpopular.

And firms tend to be sensitive

Starting point is 02:01:58

to that unpopularity, right?

And saying, well, hey, AI came.

We didn't make the decision.

We just, we had to sort of do.

That's a very sort of easy thing to do.

No CEO would ever do that.

That doesn't make any sense.

To, like, what, to say that AI,

Starting point is 02:02:12

I'm kidding.

I'm kidding.

What's the reason to do it?

Yeah.

Of course.

We'll use anything as air cover.

Yeah.

And so I just, in general, I caution people to say, look, it's like I've said this before.

Starting point is 02:02:24

You know, when I was in high school, a very distinguished scientist came to my science class.

And he was on like the board on like the national science, some sort of board of the National Science Foundation.

He was like a geneticist.

And he came and he said like that he envied and also felt bad.

for us because the human genome project was going to so radically change human life that

we were going to see things that he couldn't imagine, but also the job of doctor wouldn't

exist in 10 years.

And this, I was in high school in like 1998.

Starting point is 02:02:57

This probably happened.

So, you know, studying medicine.

Right, right.

And you quit.

Right.

Like, you know, like, if you can actually, but this is an exercise that people can do at

home, which is to go back, like, just to Google and look at the predictions about what

people thought the human genome project would do.

Starting point is 02:03:14

Obviously, genetic research in general is very important.

But there was a real belief among very intelligent and highly credentialed people that we

were on the verge of something absolutely humanity changing.

And life's more complicated than that.

And again, like, I just, I want AI boosters to do more showing and less predicting.

Yeah.

Right.

Show me, right?

Starting point is 02:03:38

Like, show me the change instead of predicting the change.

Yeah.

Well, thank you so much for taking the time to come chat with us.

This is really fun.

Yeah.

Yeah, we have this conversation.

We have these debates, you know, kind of debates and conversations all the time.

Specifically, there's a popular influencer on Instagram that every time a tech company does a bunch of layoffs and says we did this because of AI, he takes that and, like, makes this crazy story up around how, you know, AI is just immediately causing all this job loss.

Starting point is 02:04:08

And I'm just looking at it as like, I know the kind of.

company. They had a lot of bloat. They're getting some efficiency increase because of AI.

But certainly it wasn't like the 2000 people or whatever were sitting there being like,

oh yeah, I just onboarded this new agent. And now it does everything that I did,

including going to all the meetings and sitting around all day. So there's an incentive on both sides.

Both the AI boosters and the AI bears sort of have an incentive to be like, it's going too fast.

it's going wrong.

If you love AI, you want to say it's going really fast.

Starting point is 02:04:44

If you don't like AI, you want to say it's going too fast.

They're both sort of a line so you get this like super cycle.

Very fascinating.

Well, have a great rest of your day.

And thank you so much for taking the time to come chat with us.

Cheers.

Let me tell you about graphite code review for the age of AI.

Graphite helps teams on GitHub ship higher quality software faster.

Starting point is 02:05:03

And our next guest is in the re-stream waiting room.

We have Sohail Prasad from Destiny.

What's going on?

Hey, how's it going?

Great.

Thank you for having me.

Great to finally have you on the show.

We met once.

Starting point is 02:05:16

I think it was too long ago to remember what we were even talking about, but it's great to see you again.

And a lot going on in your world.

So why don't you kick off quick kind of background on yourself and then let's talk about destiny?

Sure.

Great to see you.

Thanks for having me.

Founded Forge, a stock market for private companies back in 2014.

took that public in 2022, and then Schwab bought us last year.

Starting point is 02:05:45

And in 2020, started a company called Destiny to Bring Public Access to Private Tech.

So along the way, I realized that there's such a big inequity.

Most people in the world that use, you know, all the companies that are advertisers for you guys,

that are tech companies in our everyday lives, you have no way of owning that

and wanted to create a way for anyone to own a piece of that future from the convenience of their brokerage account.

Very, very cool.

I've been, yeah, following Destiny since you launched it.

How long did it actually take to get it up and running?

Starting point is 02:06:19

There's a number of groups now that have seen what you've done or maybe had a similar idea

and are trying to bring products to market, but you've got a nice little head start.

I guess the journey really did start with Forge.

It was probably couldn't have pulled Destiny off without having having done that first and had all of that understanding of the market.

But yeah, what were kind of like, what was the logic around the decision for kind of the current structure and all the decisions that made that went into building the initial product and then kind of where is it going from here?

Sure.

Yeah, thinking about what the dream product is, it kind of looks like QQQ for private tech.

That's a dream.

Starting point is 02:07:04

Anyone can buy it on any given day.

Anyone can sell it.

It has exposure to a broad base of private tech companies.

Now, structurally, they're definitely challenges.

You know, an open-end ETF, you don't have enough liquidity in the underlying private

companies that would support the creation of shares on a given basis or redemption on a daily basis.

So we looked across the market at what kind of structures are possible and ultimately decided that a listed closed-end fund gets that intraday liquidity.

It's listed on the NYC.

Starting point is 02:07:37

It's accessible, but you're still able to go invest in these companies.

So it took us quite a while.

We spent 19 months waiting for registration with the SEC in the first time.

We listed in March of 2024.

and then we spent another 15 months waiting for the SEC to approve our shelf.

Overnight success. I love it. Walk me through the mechanics of the closed end fund.

That means that you own shares in private companies. When I buy shares in Destiny and then I go to sell them.

I'm not selling them to you. I'm selling them to Jordi. Is that right or someone else in the market?

Starting point is 02:08:19

Exactly. So we trade intraday on the NYSC.

market just closed, but anytime you want, you can go into your Schwab account. You can buy DXYZ,

you can sell it. And it's all effectively secondary market trading. You're not creating or redeeming

shares. Now, last year, we got approval from the SEC, got effectiveness to raise up to a billion

dollars opportunistically. And that allows us to issue new shares, use the capital we raise from that,

and then invest in new companies. Okay. So if there's a, if there's a Delta in NAF,

to market cap, it's because there's expectations about what you'll buy with those shares, maybe?

Yeah, early on, there was a huge delta as people found out that this was even possible back in

Starting point is 02:09:03

2024. And I think that was just people realizing, oh, wow, I can actually do this. I don't have

to go anywhere. I don't have to make a new account. I can buy this. And people got really excited.

And now, you know, that premium has come down just as we've gotten more mature. I kind of, we had a

decision to make when we brought it to the market, which is we wanted to have a portfolio of the top

100 private tech companies. Should we wait until we build a whole portfolio? Should we just list it

with no companies in the portfolio? And we decided, hey, we'll build it effectively in public.

So we've listed with 20-some-odd companies. Today we have 35 and we're kind of growing that

over time. What were the conversations like originally with companies? Obviously, you're not always

Starting point is 02:09:49

buying direct access or not getting direct exposure, but you're buying into SPVs or things like that.

But what were the conversations like in the beginning?

How are they going now?

With Robin Hood's new product, it sounds like at least some of it is actually being

like authorized by the company or they're like effectively signing off on it or cool with it.

I'm sure in other cases companies are less excited about it, but like,

give us an overview there.

Yeah, but the secondary market, it's always, even for the last 15 years, been case-by-case basis.

Starting point is 02:10:29

Some companies have really active secondary markets, and they facilitate it.

Others try to keep more of a tight control.

From day one with Destiny, what we did is make sure we have flexibility to invest across the board.

So we've invested in companies that are doing primary rounds.

We recently invest in a company called Skilled AI.

SoftBank led that round, and we were a part of that round. We partnered with Beast Industries

and are working directly with them. And then at the same time, we can also opportunistically buy

through secondary markets. So sometimes they're employees or early investors that need

Starting point is 02:11:03

liquidity, and they come directly to us, and we can buy from them.

Part of why Destiny's exciting and other products are exciting is that, is that

anyone can get exposure to the asset class.

The challenges that oftentimes, by the time you know, a company is amazing, and it should be in the Destiny 100,

it's already been marked up to 50, 60, you know, billion or whatever the number is, sometimes eight.

In the case of SpaceX, you know, hundreds of billions.

What are your plans around, obviously picking companies at the super early stage is hard.

It's also very risky.

Starting point is 02:11:48

Part of the appeal of Destiny is that you're getting exposure to companies that we already know are solid.

They're well capitalized.

They're hopefully leaders in their market.

But how are you thinking about like qualification for Destiny?

And would you ever go earlier stage?

Is that too risky?

All that stuff.

Yeah.

Starting point is 02:12:11

That's one of the reasons we decided to call it the Destiny Tech 100 and target building out of

portfolio of 100. You want to have enough range in there so you can have some of the early

unicorns, you call it, one, two, three billion dollar companies that have in many cases,

product market fit. They have growth, but they have, you know, more room to grow, as well as

at the same time, some of the larger companies that are tens, now hundreds of billions of dollars

and beyond. And so we will have over time a mix of those companies so that we can kind of get some

of those earlier stage, albeit still late stage bets, and others that are, you know, the blue-chip

mature companies.

Starting point is 02:12:53

How do you think about the actual investing strategy?

Is, are there any, like, I mean, you mentioned like post-unicorn, are there heuristics or

firm rules that are in a bylaws, or are you just sort of like the fund manager and you're

tasked by the shareholders to make the best investments that are according to your own intuition,

skill, obviously your incredible background, all of that. But how do you think about the actual

capital allocation question? Yeah. So right now the portfolio is in progress. So you look,

sometimes we might be overweight one company. For a while, SpaceX was greater than 40% of our

portfolio that's come down. And so we're kind of in this building phase. As we reach a more steady

Starting point is 02:13:39

state, we want to be reflective of the late stage venture back ecosystem. So we actually publish

rules and eligibility criteria on our website where like, you know, companies had to raise

recent rounds of financing. The other kind of growth metrics and TAM that we look at.

But generally speaking, we don't want it to be, you know, whatever we like on a given Monday.

We want to say, hey, we want overall late stage venture back exposure. And where we get to

use our discretion as, hey, what's the right time to buy this? What's the right structure? What's

the right pricing? Things like that, where if you just had an index, you would be a forced buyer at any

price, at any structure. And so it gives us the ability to go and find unique opportunities in the

Starting point is 02:14:27

primary, secondary markets and actually invest behind that. What's the process when a company

in the portfolio IPOs? You have a number of portfolio companies that will be IPOing,

or should IPO this year, there's a lockup period.

And then I imagine you guys plan to exit those positions and then recycle the capital.

But how are you thinking about that?

Yeah.

So we want to be long-term capital partners for the company.

And so generally, once a company goes public, we're not selling our shares immediately.

Starting point is 02:15:00

We'll wait for a few years.

Instacart was one of the companies in the portfolio that went public.

and we waited for a few years before we slowly started divesting that position.

And so that's how we're trying to balance, you know, the two things, which is our public shareholders are looking to us for exposure into private markets,

but we also want to be great partners for companies and smooth their transition as they go public.

It's amazing.

Well, congrats on all the progress.

So what was the talk about the most recent acquisition or investments?

Starting point is 02:15:34

you guys are in Anthropic for $100 million breakdowns

with new companies.

Yeah, so we just announced a couple weeks ago

that we closed in $100 million investment,

secondary purchase in Anthropic.

I mentioned skilled AI based in this race.

He's like, I can't let you get out of here without a gong.

I knew it.

Starting point is 02:15:59

That's right.

Very cool.

Well, yeah, we're excited to continue.

to follow destiny and the overall, overall market. You guys have definitely led the charge.

Second time leading the charge. It felt like with Ford, you guys were very ahead of the curve

and ahead here as well. So great to have you on. Thanks. More to come.

Amazing. We'll talk to you soon. Cheers. Have a good one. Let me tell you about Label Box,

reinforcement learning environments, voice, robotics, evals, and expert human data. Labelbox is the

Starting point is 02:16:30

data factory behind the world's leading AI teams. And let me also tell you,

tell you about vibe.co, where D2C brands, B2B startups, and AI companies advertise on streaming TV,

pick channels, target audiences, measure sales, just like on meta. And before we bring in our next

guest, we have some breaking news. It's Jensen's birthday from Nvidia. And guess what? He was born on the same

exact day, same year as Michael Jordan. I thought... It really is the Michael Jordan of GPU.

Dylan Averscotta on our team is such an underrated poster. Got 8,000 likes just with two screenshots.

One, Jensen's birthday, the other, Michael Jordan.

Playmaker.

Starting point is 02:17:07

February 17th, 1963.

Happy birthday to Jensen.

And thank you for all you do.

I'm going to tell you about Shopify,

before we bring in our next guest.

Shopify is a commerce platform that grows with your business

and lets you sell in seconds online, in store, on mobile,

on social, on marketplaces, and now with AI agents.

Starting point is 02:17:25

And without further ado, let's bring in our next guest, Travis,

from Nash Optical.

Travis, how are you doing?

Hey, nice to meet you guys.

Nice to me, too.

me on. Thanks for hopping on. Big, big, big day. Huge day. We saw the news. What else happened on February 17th?

We launched on February 17th as well. That's true. That's true. Add it to the list. How much did you raise? Break it down for us. Yeah, 50 million total across our seat in Series A.

Nice. Congratulations.

Starting point is 02:17:56

First time on the show, before we get into Mesh, introduce yourself. What got you into this? All that good stuff.

Yeah, I'm Travis Bershears.

One of the co-founders and CEO here at Mesh Optical,

and I've been working on laser since I was in high school

and with a professor at UCSC.

Philip Lubin, and then I went to Berkeley.

Oh, interesting.

So in high school, you were basically studying at UCSB.

Starting point is 02:18:26

You're studying the laser beam.

Yep.

The laser being.

I was studying the beam.

Studying the laser.

That's right.

Been one with the laser since I was, you know, 15.

And then I went to SpaceX and started working on the space laser com system there

Starting point is 02:18:41

and got to the really fortunate opportunity to design

and work with a really awesome team there on the free space laser com terminal.

Cool.

So talk about...

Living the space laser dream.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So talk about the actual product, you know, how much of this is still R&D ready for commercialization.

Starting point is 02:19:01

Then I want to talk about the implications.

like how this product actually rolls out into the world.

Yeah, yeah.

So our first product is a plugable transceiver

that is used in all of the GPU clusters.

So you just mentioned Jensen.

Yeah.

Like the NVIDIA GPU clusters.

Starting point is 02:19:18

For every one GPU, there's like four to five

of these optical interconnects that help connect all the GPUs

together through the networking

through making sure that they can be like a coherent cluster.

And so the first product we're making

is what we call like a linear plugable optic.

and it deletes a really expensive and costly,

like power-hungry thing that is called a retimer or DSP.

Starting point is 02:19:41

And so it allows the people who deploy compute to save a lot of the power.

And so that first product is just simply allowing those GPs to connect over optical

and deleting some power-hungry chip inside.

And this is within a data center or in between different data centers?

This is within the data center.

Yeah.

So our first product is, yeah, within the data center, they connect them with fiber optic cable on either end.

And yeah, and so the big thing that is-

Starting point is 02:20:10

These are already in market.

You're selling these.

Wow.

Well, ours are the, we're standing up the production line.

So we care a lot about co-locating the engineering talent with the manufacturing.

One of the key things we learn at SpaceX is to be right where the stuff is built.

So behind me is the manufacturing line.

And we'll start testing in the next month here, some samples,

Starting point is 02:20:35

and then start scaling production right after that.

And trying to get to millions of units in 2027 is like really where the high volume starts to come into play.

Wow.

Is this the kind of thing where it's really just execution risk?

Like, can we build this at scale?

And if we can build them, there's insane demand and it's less demand risk?

Yeah, the demand we sort of think of as infinite because, you know, the more intelligence we have, the more intelligence we have, it just like is more compute. And so whenever you see people deploying more and more compute, they need more and more transceivers. And so as intelligence scales with compute, so does transceiver demand.

$50 million in the bank. Where are you based in the company? How big is the team? What does the next 12 to 18 months look like for you?

Starting point is 02:21:29

yeah we were based in los angeles we're in gardina california

it's a little of lasers

thank you thank you at los angeles needed to win

yeah yeah um yeah a little outside el secundo but uh yeah we're gonna bring gardina onto the map

of the the laser hub of of the world um love it and uh yeah so we're about 15 people now

and growing quickly and need to move to a bigger building now

Are there like two buyers for this?

Are you going to do deals with like every data center builder, every NeoCloud, just the hyper-scalers?

Starting point is 02:22:07

Are you going to be a supply chain partner like just to NVIDia or just to AMD?

Like what does your business look like in like that scale?

Yeah, we want to sell.

I mean, our long-term goal here is to be able to connect all things with optical photons.

and whether that's an interconnect in a data center

or an interconnect in space,

whether that's free space or in a fiber.

But to start out to answer your question specifically,

Starting point is 02:22:35

like anyone who deploys compute on the ground,

we will try to sell to.

That could be a neocloud, as you mentioned.

It could be a hyperscaler.

We have a strategy that we want to follow,

to kind of match our volume to our potential future customers

and make sure we don't start all the way

at like really high volume because obviously we need to scale our line. We care a lot about

Starting point is 02:22:58

getting our manufacturing done here in the United States. One thing about all these transceivers

that are made today, they're all made overseas. They're made mostly in China and Thailand.

And so no one has like really stood up these high precision, what they're called flip chip

dye bonding or pick in place machines. Like when we bought the most high volume flip chip die bonder,

they asked for your Chinese social credit number on it.

Because no one buys them here.

Wow.

Do you think that we'll get any mesh products in space in the next five years?

Starting point is 02:23:39

Yeah.

That's awesome.

There we go.

2027, you think of what I'm thinking?

Valentine's Day gifts.

Here we go for that special person.

Layers for valetis for valentines.

Crazier things have happened.

Starting point is 02:23:53

We're big.

of,

uh,

girlfriend,

yeah,

they like,

they keep saying they want some metal,

you know.

Starting point is 02:23:58

Yeah.

So get them,

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I was a,

I was a laser cat

Starting point is 02:24:04

for Halloween once.

No way.

Oh,

that's cool.

Yeah.

Talk about,

like,

what is the shape of like,

Starting point is 02:24:12

actually working in the factory?

Is this stuff risky?

Or does it all happen

in a clean room?

How much of this is like a TSM-C type fab?

Like,

what is it like the day?

Yeah.

Starting point is 02:24:23

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

The,

The clean room is here.

We actually took some panels off to get the machines in.

But yeah, it's a pretty, like, we take the approach of, like, question the requirements

and delete the part of process if we need to.

Starting point is 02:24:36

And, you know, we start in, like, a semi-dirty environment to make sure, like, we want to,

we don't want to go overboard, right?

You don't want to just go all in on a clean room when you don't have to.

So actually, back at SpaceX, we started making a space space space as there's in a tent.

And so, like, there's actually a tent behind me, or in front of me, sorry.

And so, like, you want to not, you don't want to go too all in on, like, it has to be in a

clean room.

You do test, end-of-line testing and qualification to make sure that, like, if it starts to impact your yield, then you would implement procedures and processes to keep it cleaner.

Starting point is 02:25:13

This is, like, a pretty good clean room, but not the best.

And so we'll see how our yield looks with this one.

and we'll implement stronger strategies if we need to.

But, yeah, all of our semiconductor packaging is happening here.

And, you know, we get some dyes from other foundries that are all outside of Asia.

And then we bring them here and package them.

Last question for me.

What was the biggest lesson you learned from working at SpaceX?

Starting point is 02:25:43

I mean, just what I said is, like, question the requirements and delete the part and process.

It's like, it's so simple.

But it's so useful.

And like when we're designing something, like you want to try to know why each part is there.

So in our design, we've deleted quite a few parts.

And most people don't delete that part.

But it ends up work.

Anytime you delete a part, you delete a potential failure mode.

Starting point is 02:26:09

And you want to be like a really reliable system.

You need to delete as many parts or processes as possible.

It also helps you like assemble things faster.

So that was one of the big lessons I learned.

Yeah, that feels like, I don't know, easy to.

say really hard to do in practice.

Like it feels like you have to experience it.

Like I've heard that a million times and like I'm sure that there's things that I could

Starting point is 02:26:30

delete like even my daily workflow that I haven't figured out how to do.

That's, I love that.

Yeah, SpaceX is a company where like you learn learning things the hard way.

Yeah.

In the most extreme way.

Yeah.

Most of you ship a piece of software.

It doesn't work.

Starting point is 02:26:45

It's like, okay, let's patch it.

You ship a rocket.

It has some like dependency that you didn't think was maybe that important.

and it blows up and you've got to live with that.

Or the whole laser mesh doesn't work.

Let's hope that doesn't happen.

Putting a kid in charge of that is really a crazy thing that SpaceX does

is they hand the baton to a really young person

Starting point is 02:27:09

and put the whole company on the company on those people.

And I think that forges things within people to be able to deliver

and then the delete the part and process

helps them understand the whole system really well.

I love it.

Well, we are not far from Gardinia.

Yeah, come by.

Come by for your next appearance.

Starting point is 02:27:31

I've got a feeling you'll be back on the show this year.

Great, yeah, I would love to be there.

You guys are welcome to come anytime as well.

I love it.

I love.

I love lasers.

I would love to.

Have a great rest of your day.

Starting point is 02:27:41

We'll talk soon.

Let me tell you about Plaid.

Plad powers the apps you use to spend,

save, borrow, and invest securely connecting bank.

It counts to move money, fight fraud, and improve lending.

Now with AI.

And you saw it at the opener.

Jordy, get those juggle balls ready because it's time to tell you about turbo puffer.

Starting point is 02:27:59

Serverless vector in Fultex search, built from first principles and object storage.

Fast.

10x cheaper and extremely scalable.

The team sent me these little puffers.

They're incredible.

Jordi's juggling abilities.

Very fast.

They're going to be hard to keep here at the studio.

Starting point is 02:28:11

Well, without further ado, we have Evan Spiegel from Snap in the TBPN Ultradome.

Good to see you again, Evan. Welcome to the show. Welcome back to the show.

Thank you so much. Coming by and stopping by the TB pin Ultrodrome.

You're outsuited me. You're outsuited me. That is a beautiful suit.

It's always a great excuse to wear a suit. My wife was like, where are you going today?

I like the buttons that don't show through. I don't know what that's called, but that's a touch of like some, it's very tasteful.

Thank you. I appreciate that. Are you in, are you following the taste discourse? People are saying that taste is important. Do you have a stance on this?

in the context of building software.

Starting point is 02:28:51

It's more of like a post-AI thing.

Like, AI is going to be able to do everything, but not taste.

And it's just like, it's sort of always been obvious,

but it's also fun to write about.

It's fun to talk about.

There's a whole bunch of interesting examples.

It's funny you say that because our designers are literally becoming engineers right now.

So it's kind of like, you know, I mean, if you think about like 10 years ago, right,

Starting point is 02:29:09

even like the power dynamic in a company, the hard part was building things.

Right now the hard part is like having a great idea.

So I think taste is important.

I guess the question I was joking about earlier was like there's there's two ways to build a new consumer product.

One is you A, B, test the color of the button and you just look at the data.

And that's more of the engineering mindset.

And then there's the tasteful approach, which is maybe like, I just know green's the right color for my brand.

Did you engage in both throughout your journey?

Starting point is 02:29:38

Did you, is there a place for both?

Like, how do you see those two, the gut instinct interfacing with like the engineering reality?

Like somebody pulls up the chart and they tell you that it's got to.

be blue, but you know yellow's right. I think for us, like, there's a huge difference between

like generation and iteration, right? If you're trying to come up with a new idea, it is really

important that you can exercise your sort of creative opinion or judgment. I mean, you know,

the reason why we chose yellow is there were no other apps in the top 100 that were yellow.

So that was like an easy one, right, to stand out. We didn't have to be a lot of yellow.

Starting point is 02:30:12

Verticalized yellow, yeah. Us and McDonald's, I think, you know, what becomes very important, very quickly

is that you're able to iterate.

So once you put something out there,

AB testing, experimenting, that really helps.

Especially as you have a big organization,

you don't want to bottleneck people's experiments.

So anyone can experiment and learn.

Yeah, it's interesting.

Starting point is 02:30:31

One way to think about it is, like,

I feel like executives thrive if they have great taste

because they have a lot of people coming to them

with work or projects,

and it's their job to decide, like,

what are we actually going to focus and prioritize?

and now anybody can create like 20 different concepts for a website.

And so they're having to choose from that to then go up the chain and decide,

Starting point is 02:30:54

okay, which one of these should we actually implement?

But there's like, taste is becoming more important because now it's so much faster to just create anything.

So at every level of the stack of the organization, you have just like more things to choose from.

And taste is just choosing.

Taste in your personal life is like choosing like, do I get this jacket or that jacket?

or do I put, use this flooring in my house?

How many logos should be on my shirt?

That's great.

Starting point is 02:31:22

Give us the news.

Massive milestone.

What happened?

I literally came here for the gong.

You know what I mean?

It's a great strategy.

We got a bigger gong if you were here last.

Is this a new horse?

Starting point is 02:31:37

Is this like for a year of the horse?

No, we were early.

We were early.

Yeah, yeah, we were early.

Yeah, yeah, we were early.

It was really funny.

It was so funny.

So we were walking by the store.

Starting point is 02:31:46

Yeah.

And John and I were walking.

And I look inside.

The store is closed.

But all you can see, it's like kind of dark in there.

And there's just massive, it's at the, yeah, massive horse.

And I was like, we need one of those immediately.

John's like, what do you mean?

Starting point is 02:31:59

We're not going to be able to get like a horse.

And then we look on this website for like a few thousand dollars.

You can get this horse.

I was like the easiest part of buying the horse was convincing the production team

that we actually weren't joking.

Yeah.

is Jordy sends it in the chat, hey, we need a horse statue.

And he's like, oh, this is funny.

Starting point is 02:32:16

And they were like, no, we're like, no, actually go figure it out.

This is your job.

Anyway, we're not here to talk about.

Congratulations on the horse.

Thank you.

We got a horse.

You got a big miles down.

I think the horse was here last time, but it was wrapped in Christmas lights and we had a massive

Starting point is 02:32:30

Christmas tree.

There were so many other things going on in the studio.

You gave us that very nice Christmas ornament, which we love.

You signed it.

But it was distracting from the horse.

But now the horse is front and center.

But more importantly,

Your direct revenue is friend and center. Give us the news.

Starting point is 02:32:44

Yeah, so we've reached a billion dollar annual run rate on our, oh wow, thank you.

Incredible.

Is the job finished?

And 25 million subscribers.

So I think that's like ESPN size for subscribers, which is like next stop Hulu, you know.

But really exciting for us as we've worked to diversify, you know, our revenue and create this whole new business line.

Yeah, like narrative, narrative violation too around social media, right?

There hasn't been a lot of people will pay for entertainment products, but there hasn't been a bunch of, like, scaled, actually like a social media product with, you know, that kind of SaaS.

Starting point is 02:33:28

Yeah, what was the reaction like when you initially launched subscriptions?

Well, I think what's so cool is people are really passionate about Snapchat.

And so they want all these new features.

And they're asking us all the time.

Like, hey, can you, you know, chat backgrounds?

or like, can we have a bitmoji pet or whatever it is.

And in the past, we would be like, oh, man, like, this is really a feature for power users, right?

Like, we can't build this, like, for a billion people.

Starting point is 02:33:50

So this gave us the justification and the resources, like, okay, fine.

Like, you know, pay us two bucks a month, have your bitmoji pets and your chat backgrounds

and all this fun stuff.

And so people just keep the requests coming.

We keep building all sorts of fun stuff.

And actually, it's great for the team because otherwise we never would have prioritized all these really

fun features.

How do people actually submit requests?

Starting point is 02:34:09

Literally email.

Email.

Email customer support.

You know, and we do like, you know, research and things.

There's a lot of the tech companies that feels like they're very faceless.

Well, it's Evan at snap.com, so it's like a little too easy to send anything.

It goes like straight to my phone, too.

We love that.

Starting point is 02:34:26

Dangerous to say that on the show.

So, yeah, what has been the key to scaling revenue there?

Has it been just driving increases in?

ARPU or just onboarding more and more people into the premium product, doing more

Top of funnel, like bringing in these prosumer users as net new users, reengaging people,

like what's been working?

Yeah, a big focus has just been continually dropping new features, letting people know about

those features, creating new entry points, you know, into the subscription service through

Starting point is 02:34:59

those features.

You know, one of the big things that we rolled out last year was memory storage.

So we've got people who are storing a lot of memories on Snapchat.

So we give like five gigs free, but if people want more than five gigs of storage, then, you know, they can either pay just for the memory storage or they can join Snapchat Plus.

It's so funny because I remember when Snapchat started, everyone was like, oh, this is genius.

They don't have to have any cloud storage costs.

And now it's like, oh, well, we're in the business, but we have a monetization scheme on top of it.

Well, 10 years later, it turns out there's a lot of cloud storage costs.

Starting point is 02:35:32

We were paying them.

Yeah.

Yeah, I've seen the Google bill.

Suffering.

Have you seen demand for AI features, and what does demand for AI features in a consumer context look like?

Absolutely. I think one of the really exciting things, people don't realize how widely used the Snapchat camera is for generative AI, you know, images and videos.

I think in Q4, 700 million people use generative AI lenses, so those are like our camera editing tools.

And we have a feature called Lens Plus, which basically takes some of the most cutting edge Gen.

Starting point is 02:36:04

Gen. AI features, you know, video generation, those sorts of things, and puts it behind a paywall.

So if you want the most advanced Gen.

AI image and video editing features, that's part of Lensplus.

How have you thought about using camera as the end-to-end editing suite versus sort of bifurcating

them, looking at what TikTok and Capcut are separate?

Edits and Instagram are separate.

When do you want to go separate?

When do you want to consolidate everything?

Starting point is 02:36:29

Generally for Snapchat, one of our strengths is how much content is actually created in our

camera because it's much more authentic.

And what we find today, especially because

everything is so overly edited and stylized because everything is created with generative AI.

What our community tells us all the time is we want authentic original content.

So for us, we really focus on stuff that's actually captured and made in our camera rather

than uploaded. And even as we think about the types of content we distribute on Spotlight

or boost in Spotlight, for example, we're thinking a lot about what's actually made in the

Starting point is 02:37:00

Snapchat camera. And this stuff is hilarious, but not edited in the same way that it might be

on other platforms.

Have you thought about how, like, agents will take hold in a social media app?

I've been trying to think about this, like, you know, the Manus Acquisition, like, what does it look like if I have an agent that can go and, you know, work its way through my social network profile?

It's like, I could kind of tell it to, like, like, like every comment that comes in that's positive and it could do some sentiment.

I don't know if I actually want that.

Like, how does that play out once you get to models that can actually run in the background?

It's not just, I ask for a question, I get an answer, or I say replace the background with a beautiful forest and it does it.

Starting point is 02:37:48

Have you thought about any of that yet?

You know, we early on brought my AI into Snapchat, right?

And that was like a great proving ground to experiment with things like, you know, personality, memory, all those sorts of things.

We're being able to bring my eye into group chats or conversations.

So I do think it's been useful in that regard. Certainly, my eye use case is very utilitarian.

We see a lot of just questions, homework, help, like that kind of stuff.

You know, on the agentic side, I'm much more excited about what's happening inside the business.

I think the potential for business transformation is off the charts.

Starting point is 02:38:21

I think, like, you know, if you look at small and medium-sized companies for the last 10, 20 years,

they've almost been like left for dead.

Everyone's been so excited about mega-cap companies.

I think the next 10 or 20 years, the efficiencies that small and medium-sized businesses can drive to grow using agents is going to be off the charts.

So I think that's like, that to me is where I'm most excited.

So is anyone writing code anymore?

Are you vibe coding stuff now?

We see every level of the spectrum.

Starting point is 02:38:47

It's either the CEOs committing code or no one's writing code.

It's always at the extreme.

But what's your experience?

It's not vibe coding anymore.

It's agentic engineering.

Yes, yes, yes.

I think, look, I think what's really interesting about,

what we're seeing in SNAP is that like at to some degree, you know, and because the company's

Starting point is 02:39:03

been around for a while, you know, it's operating at two speeds. Like there are team members who

have fully embraced agenic engineering, right, and who are essentially not writing code, right? And

then there are other teams that are still operating in a more traditional way. So, you know,

because this change is happening so quickly, one of the things we're very focused on is driving

these tools through the company, you know, really making sure that folks embrace this new way of

working, helping train folks to do that because, you know, certainly for a quite a question.

a number of folks, they are not writing code in the way they used to.

What's the next development that you're most excited about?

Starting point is 02:39:37

Is it just understanding the code at a deeper level, sort of like a higher IQ model,

or thinking in systems and scalability?

Like, it's not, you know, some tiny app.

Like there's so many users on here.

One tiny change can have massive ramifications across a database.

The stakes are a lot higher.

what are you looking for in the advancing in the tools of AI tools to actually improve your business?

Yeah, for us, it's really just right now about building agents across the enterprise, right? So whether

Starting point is 02:40:09

it's like, you know, somebody reports a bug, the agent goes out, figures out who else is a

bug like it, actually tries to go figure it out, right? Proposes a fix, right? Those sorts of things.

Or, you know, you look at our sales team, right, and all the work they're doing, everything from really

trying to understand the client's objectives, generating insights for them, putting that together into a

presentation, mapping it to our, you know, advertising solutions. Like, you know, I think there's

just a huge opportunity. Yeah, even even thinking an advertiser that spends $20,000 a year

with you guys should eventually, should in the relative near term get the same type of presentation

and like almost like high touch experience that somebody spending $10 million should get, right?

Starting point is 02:40:50

And that doesn't feel like a lot of that is like people making slide decks, like really being on it,

like being timely with like kind of feedback or, you know, things like that.

Sure, sure.

That feels like very within reach with agents.

Yeah, walk me through the current pitch to advertisers.

When you meet with a new big company, I'm sure everyone's used, you know,

your advertising product at this point, but let's assume there's some new hot company

that is growing.

Starting point is 02:41:20

They have a physical product or something and they want to grow their customer base,

grow their reach.

how are you positioning your offering on the advertising side?

Nearly billion user platform, including more than 110 million monthly active users right here in the United States,

in this really, really important 13 to 34 demographic.

And the reason why that demographic is so important is because they are forming lifelong relationships with brands and with products.

And not to mention, they're making their first car purchase, their first home mortgage.

I mean, even their first, like, tuba toothpaste, right?

Starting point is 02:41:50

So I think those are the sorts of really important long-term brand,

relationships that are so critical.

You're sure I'm still using the same toothpaste brand I bought when I was 19 or something.

I have not churned from that company.

The LTV is probably through the roof.

Does, but so do you have to stress the importance of thinking in not a ROAS, not a one-year

LTV payback, but thinking about capturing a customer that could stick around for a decade

or more because their younger audience?

Starting point is 02:42:21

Is that something that's resonating?

I think that fundamentally Roaz is critically important.

It's something that we really optimize towards.

And a lot of people use lower funnel objectives on Snapchat.

That's been a huge driver of growth for us,

especially with the small and medium customer segment

because folks are very sensitive to their return on investment.

But when I talk to advertisers about why they love using us,

Starting point is 02:42:40

it's always the new customer metric.

That is why they're coming to Snapchat.

They say if I look at the percentage of new customers I'm getting

when I spend on Snapchat, that really moves the needle for my business

and it moves a needle for me over the long term.

And it feels less like a tax, which happens on some other platforms.

These people were already coming to my, they were looking for me,

and I had to pay for that.

Starting point is 02:43:01

It's frustrating.

George did something?

Yeah.

What are you excited about in AI hardware broadly and everything that you guys are working on?

It feels like this will be a massive year for hardware across the board.

You've got, you know, Apple, you know, people have been reporting,

I think, this week on multiple new.

hardware devices, there was that

Starting point is 02:43:23

somewhat believable

looking like Open AI

Open AI

But anyways, a lot of action going on, a lot of energy

and excitement, you guys are in a good position

because you've been working on it for

a better part of a decade now.

Yeah, I mean, it's a transformational year

Starting point is 02:43:41

for SNAP

in this regard. We just spun out

specs into its own standalone subsidiary,

so it's really going from like, you know, R&D

science project to like real

after almost 12 years.

So that is really important for us.

I think it intersects with some of the things

Starting point is 02:43:58

that we were just talking about

in terms of the evolution of AI

because one of the biggest things

I think folks have been concerned about

when it comes to building a new computing platform

is how to compete with the lock-in

that the app stores have.

How can you possibly compete

Starting point is 02:44:13

with all these other app stores?

And I think literally at the beginning of this year,

people realize like software isn't a moat anymore,

that like having an app store

isn't a mode anymore

because it's so,

easy to build software.

You can even build software on the fly, right?

Starting point is 02:44:24

And that, to me, is really exciting and coming at an amazing moment.

What can you do to lean in?

I saw somebody had hacked a pair of smart glasses to work with OpenClaw.

And I imagine, like, is there anything that you would do on that front to really lean into

the whole kind of like hacker movement around AI?

Because there's like, you guys are building a bunch of experiences internally.

We've used a lot of them that are very cool.

but at the same time opening it up and saying like, hey, this is a platform that anybody can build on.

Starting point is 02:44:55

And we've seen this even with the kind of the Mac mini movement, Mac minis are starting to sell out in different points around the country.

People are obviously willing to spend real money to experiment around all these products.

I think the big thing that you're sort of circling is the way that people are using their computers is really changing, right?

And they're really just supervising agents doing work for them.

And that is a perfect fit for specs.

Because the whole idea is to stop spending all this time hunched over your laptop or staring at this.

We were at breakfast this morning in this guy.

I didn't take a picture because it would have been rude in violation of his privacy.

Starting point is 02:45:31

But his posture was literally like it was the most insane posture.

He needed his back.

He's getting acoly.

One way or another, it's peak performance.

He's getting acquired.

I'm calling it now.

I know we're going to see this guy.

But yeah, like it feels the weight.

Starting point is 02:45:47

on his laptop. What you're imagining, which is like we can all just spend all of our day

walking around, being productive, monitoring agents, and it kind of a heads-up display.

It feels within reach. It does. Finally.

Yeah, it's incredibly exciting. So it's cool that all of this stuff is coming together,

you know, in this moment. And I think, you know, it is super important for us to be investing

in hardware because we talked about software's not a mode anymore, right? So it becomes even more

important to do very hard things in the real world at a time when software is being disrupted in this

way. Yeah, but at the same time, I feel you guys are in a unique position because it doesn't feel,

Starting point is 02:46:25

well, like looking at the video game industry, I think that AI will present like a pretty huge

challenge for a lot of these, you know, smaller studios that were just in the business of like

spending a few years making a game, releasing it. If it becomes way easier to build a game,

that's bad for them, but it might be great for like a Fortnite or a Roblox or one of these platforms

that have these big existing social networks.

And so I feel like your core business of actually still being a social network where people are

connecting with other real humans is in a good position.

And so, yeah, the hardware is just like a bonus.

Starting point is 02:47:05

And one of the things we've been thinking a lot about, you know, is both with the front graph

and in terms of our distribution, how do we leverage all these amazing tools to just

start building more apps, right?

Like one of the things that we always love to do

is come up with new ideas.

In the past, we've been like, oh, we got a great idea,

but we gotta build it, oh man, right now,

you know, I was just looking today,

Starting point is 02:47:22

we have a really, I mean, I shouldn't even be saying.

Something coming soon, anyway.

We've got a wild new idea that we're working on.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, I was gonna ask,

have you been pitched by the vibe coding?

Like, do people wanna be able to like send an app around,

basically that they just prompt on the fly?

Starting point is 02:47:40

I think so, and I think what's gonna be really interesting

about all these companies, like before so many of their resources were dedicated to engineering,

now I think people are going to be much more focused on marketing, on distribution, right?

And that's a big shift in the way that these.

Being able to send somebody an app that you just made for them, that historically you would

have just sent a funny picture to your friend.

This was my experience sending you sorrows of me walking on the beach in the Volta themed suit.

It was like I was able to make an in-joke with me and my three friends in a group chat that would not do well on social media broadly.

Starting point is 02:48:15

You have to have all this context, but because the cost of generating new content had dropped so low, I could do something that didn't require a costume department and cameras getting set up or all those different things.

Talk a little bit more about Gen AI.

There's a lot of crazy video models are releasing.

It seems like a lot of companies are moving fast and breaking a lot of things.

things specifically in like the Hollywood's or Hollywood's not happy about this stuff.

Like what does a responsible rollout of generative video features look like?

What a great question.

So I think for us we have a lot of safeguards in place, you know, both around basic things.

Starting point is 02:48:54

Like you shouldn't be able to make somebody nude, you know, or you or put in a compromising

position or that sort of thing.

You know, you shouldn't reproduce copyrighted content, those sorts of things.

So we, you know, as we look at, you know, even open-prompt experiences where people can ask for, you know, to create different sorts of photos and videos, we try to layer in safeguards to prevent that sort of thing from happening.

And we do a lot of adversarial testing to make sure, you know, that that is unlikely to have.

And then in terms of lenses, sponsored lenses, different experiences that partners are bringing to the platform, I'm interested to know what's the shape of the,

ecosystem like are there are there are there random developers out there who are

making things and then earning some sort of rev share from that is there actually

Starting point is 02:49:42

a flywheel there or is it particularly like you're working with a brand and

they're going to do a sponsored lens and like your team is developing that for

them what is that side of the business look like yeah it it absolutely spans the

spectrum so there's a hundred thousand more than well gosh maybe four hundred

thousand developers now who who built lenses yeah for for Snapchat and and

increasingly for specs as well you know it

Those developers can apply to include their lenses in Lens Plus and earn a revenue share out from that,

you know, if people are engaging with their lens and that kind of thing.

Starting point is 02:50:11

Then we've got a whole, you know, internal studio as well.

So we can work with advertisers if they want to build a unique experience or we have tons of partner studios who we can connect them with.

But, you know, increasingly there's a tool called Easy Lens.

It's pretty fun.

If you pull it up and just play with it, you can build a lens from a prompt.

That's what I was going to ask.

I imagine that that has to be acceleratory for you, right?

It's huge for us.

Starting point is 02:50:31

And again, we're thinking a lot about how to connect, you know, the,

We have Lens Studio, which is more of the pro tool,

and then we have Easy Lens, which allows anyone to create with the prompt.

But I think even Lens Studio itself is going to become much more oriented around agentic engineering rather than...

Yeah, because you just prompt it, and it's wiring up whatever your domain-specific language is.

Very interesting. Yeah. Are you starting to see an actual kink in the graph of lenses that are being deployed yet?

or do you think that this is something that comes once people realize that it's actually easier to go into?

Yeah, it's so interesting.

Starting point is 02:51:09

We, like, there's some dynamic on the internet that I feel like is somewhat real where the,

the more funny you think something is, like, the less likely it is to be, like, actually viral.

The Hayes Paradox.

Yeah, I jokingly called this the Hayes Paradox, which is also a Hayes Paradox.

It doesn't work.

It's just never working through.

But, yeah, it's this idea that, like, something that is, like,

Actually, the funniest thing that you see on the internet for an entire year

Starting point is 02:51:36

might have a tam of close to one or your group chat.

But that's great if you're talking about giving people tools that allow them to generate

hyper-personalized things that are only funny to them or like a handful of their closest friends.

It's like actually gives you the ability to create a lot more joy on your platform.

And that's exactly what we see with Gen.

that people are using it for these more communication-oriented use cases, but on the content

consumption side, it's the authentic, original, unedited, non-AI content that does super well.

So definitely a major contrast there.

Starting point is 02:52:13

And I think, you know, as it pertains to easy lens, when we start rolling that out, we saw a huge

step change in the lenses that were being created.

So that's become a big focus for us.

But I also think you can imagine in a not-so-distant future, I mean, now the way that the models

work, it's very hard to scale real-time image transformations, which, or one of the way that

one of the reasons why I think people love lenses, because it almost feels like you're looking in a mirror, right, and transforming what you look like.

I think in the not-so-distance future, a lot of lenses will just be prompts, right? And those prompts are going to be shareable. And, you know, we have a whole feature right now around the imagined lenses of some of our other generative lenses where we have trending prompts and you can share prompts with your friends and, you know, iterate on them. And I think, again, kind of tying back to the importance of the friend graph, I think you see that intersection of people creating these like inside jokes, but then also being able to really easily share them with their friends, have people create their own content.

inspired by those prompts.

Starting point is 02:53:01

Yeah.

It's pretty cool.

Yeah, that seems really, really important.

I mean, whenever one of these new image models goes viral,

the stuff, there's always some like ground truth,

meme, human element that's underlying it.

I think of the studio Ghibli moment.

It's like, I've seen cartoons.

Starting point is 02:53:19

I could just go look at a cartoon,

but I haven't seen a cartoon of me.

And so there's a little bit of that in there,

so the lenses make perfect sense in that case.

Let's get the California update.

what's on your mind broadly in the state.

Going better than ever, right?

It seems to just get better and better.

Starting point is 02:53:36

I don't know how we...

I mean, if we didn't have this weather,

we'd really be in a tough spot.

I mean, it's incredible what we get away with.

I know, it really, it really is.

That's got to be a big piece of it.

The weather is fantastic.

Although yesterday it was a little rainy.

Starting point is 02:53:51

Yeah, yeah.

Basically, California has, like, karma for forever flexing the weather

on the rest of the state.

Like how many times I've messaged a friend and they'll say like, oh, it's like, it's like five degrees out right now.

And I'm like, oh, it's like 71.

It's going to be that way all week.

And so in exchange, in exchange, we get like the gnarliest political environment.

It's a little chilly today.

Starting point is 02:54:17

It's 56.

That's sweatshirt weather.

It is.

It's freezing.

It's freezing.

Stay indoors.

Yeah.

This is crazy.

Starting point is 02:54:27

But yeah, broadly.

How do you think California is going?

Yeah, I'm concerned.

What gives me some optimism is that it looks like more and more people are increasingly

concerned.

What I was most worried about, you know, even six to nine months ago, was the number of people

that, like, thought things were going really well in California because they were contrasting

with what they were seeing at the federal level, right?

Starting point is 02:54:48

And feeling like, oh, California is better.

It seems like, you know, there's less chaos here or whatever, you know, because we've got

a single party state essentially.

And so I think now more and more people are, you know, are.

hearing that we're number one in terms of homelessness, number one in terms of poverty,

right? You know, number one in terms of unemployment. And they're like, whoa, like, that doesn't

line up with the California that I love that I want to be a part of. Like, how can we change that

and fix that? So I think the awareness is really important because, you know, in a democracy,

Starting point is 02:55:14

without awareness, you're not going to get change. And so I think, you know, hopefully that will

continue to build. I think, you know, if Newsom decides to run for president, that's going to, I think,

raise even more awareness of California and the challenges that we're facing here, which,

again, I think we'll be helpful. So right now, to me, it's really an awareness game of helping

make sure Californians understand. Like, this is not going in a direction that I think we want.

And if we want change, then we're going to have to ask for that, right, and advocate for that.

But I think that's happening more and more, you know, which gives me some hope.

Yeah, makes a lot of sense. I want to ask about live streaming. How do you think about it?

Starting point is 02:55:52

It feels like it's having a little bit of a moment with the clavicular stuff. I don't know if you've been

What is this?

I love this.

So locked in.

So locked in.

He famously got frame-mogged.

Yeah, running.

No, yeah.

Starting point is 02:56:06

So you're running, you know, I have a billion users on the internet.

But there's basically a number of creators on KICC that have generated probably 100 billion views,

like some absurd number that one John referenced is from the looks maxing community.

which is effectively guys that try to be as good looking as they possibly can.

So it's basically this whole drum, it's kind of like WWE brought to very internet native.

There's all these different characters.

One of them is running effectively a 24-7 whenever he's sleeping, he's streaming.

So it feels like IRL live streaming is hitting, just having a really big moment right now.

Starting point is 02:56:55

how have you thought about it historically?

Does it play any type of role in Snap's future?

Or is it not something that the users actually want?

We decided to step our way there, essentially, with creator subscriptions.

So we just started testing creator subscriptions with a small group of creators.

What we find on Snapchat is that people have very, very loyal relationships with creators.

So once they subscribe, they want to come back every day and see what's new on their story

and message with them and really get to know them better

Starting point is 02:57:27

and build this deeper relationship.

So we thought creator subscriptions was a good extension

of what we're already seeing happen on Snapchat.

We're going to test that out and see how that goes,

but that will give us some of the infrastructure

to start thinking about stepping from there.

That would be an individual creator

just going live, talking with their existing follower base.

Starting point is 02:57:48

Yeah, potentially to start with their existing subscriber base

or even with their, you know,

Yeah, not necessarily even their followers more broadly,

but their existing subscriber base.

And then, you know, layering in some of the replying

and gifting and those sorts of things

before opening it up more broadly.

How have you been-

Starting point is 02:58:04

Yeah, I felt like my personal stance is that, like,

Twitch as a platform since landing at Amazon,

it's just, like, not gotten the,

not just gotten the attention that I think it potentially deserves.

I created an opportunity for the kicks of the world

to step in.

I mean, I haven't seen Andy Jesse live streaming on Twitch once.

Yeah.

Starting point is 02:58:28

And so,

I would love to see that.

I would love to see it.

That would be awesome.

That would be awesome.

That would be cool.

Yeah,

so you guys should,

Starting point is 02:58:36

you should fire up your,

and do just an earnings call on the platform.

It would be here.

I want the CFO there explaining the whole financial model,

what happened.

Keep it wonky.

It's fine.

That's what Twitch is.

Starting point is 02:58:49

Every social media platform is like a flourishing of niches.

And you find your niche.

And there's going to be some,

one there. He's like, yeah, this is amazing.

Switching gears a little bit. You mentioned

subscribers are getting close to Hulu numbers.

How have you been processing the

somewhat polished, produced vertical short form

Starting point is 02:59:10

trend that's sort of happening? I see them in the

app store. I haven't been a user, really, but

you're familiar with what I'm talking about. Real Short

is one of them. They seem to be popular. There's obviously

some organic creation that's happening on a fully UGC platform.

but how have you thought about that?

It feels like sort of revenge of quibby in some ways,

but where do you think that goes?

Starting point is 02:59:31

How important is that?

Is there a role for you to play in that ecosystem?

Yeah, I know that we've got a lot of, you know,

advertising partners who are marketing the short form videos on Snapchat.

And, you know, I mean, those ads are so,

sometimes I find myself watching one for like a minute.

And I'm like, oh, my God.

I have to know what happens.

Starting point is 02:59:48

Who killed her?

So that seems to be working.

Yeah, okay, good.

I think, you know, when we experimented with shows, you know, many years ago, I think for us,

we just found that the volume of creativity, you know, the billions of snaps being created

in the Snapchat camera meant that really, like, Snapchat is at its heart about UGC, fundamentally.

And I think in the places where we've really allowed UGC to flourish and creators to flourish,

and actually where we didn't do as many shows or didn't do as many publisher stories, we really

Starting point is 03:00:21

built a very vibrant organic creator ecosystem. So I think, you know, in sort of the ensuing

few years, we've pulled back from doing that sort of more premium content because what we just

see our community love is connecting with the folks that feel like they're next door.

Yeah. And I mean, YouTube did the same thing. YouTube read. They had a whole bunch of like

produced things. And you'd see the, it'd be like, my favorite creator got paid a bunch of money

to do something produced. And it's to get less views because like I actually just want him to

turn on the camera and just talk. I don't need.

all that other stuff because like that's not what I'm there for and I think that

Starting point is 03:00:54

recognizing the the desire of the user the context like all of that really

matters like the medium is the message right what is your how do you allocate

your time in 2026 where are you where are you spending time that you know how is

that kind of changed over the years I mean at a high level it's probably 80 20

Snapchat and specs I think that's gonna have to start shifting this year you

know, maybe not totally 50-50, but certainly close to it, just as we ramp up and, you know,

bring that product out into the world.

You know, my happy place is making new stuff with our team.

Starting point is 03:01:33

That's what I love to do.

Our design reviews, you know, whether that's, you know, with specs or with the Snapchat

team, that's really what I, what I love to do.

But, you know, a lot of what I've had to do over the past couple years is really work closely

closely with the team to rebuild the ad platform and to create a totally new, you know, this small,

medium customer segment of our advertising business.

I mean, our business three or four years ago was almost all large customers and like highly concentrated in the United States.

And when your business is concentrated on a small number of very big customers, it just creates a lot of unhelpful volatility.

Starting point is 03:02:02

And so what we've done since then is, you know, build out a platform that can deliver lower funnel goals, you know, especially the small media customers and then really diversify.

You don't get to work on the fun stuff if you don't have the economic engine.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

virtual reality. You've obviously looked at this. Haven't gone super deep in it. Over the weekend,

I watched the Matrix in VR. I also watched on Apple Vision Pro. You watched the whole Matrix in VR.

No way. No way. Yes. They said no one had ever done that before. I also watched. You made history.

Starting point is 03:02:40

It's incredible. You should hit the gong for that. I mean, that's unreal. Get the gong for yourself.

That's incredible.

But I'll give you one better.

We did it at like five minutes in.

He like takes,

I know I didn't.

I didn't.

I didn't.

Starting point is 03:03:02

I did.

I did.

I did.

But I went further on Saturday night.

I watched Terminator 2 in V.

Whoa.

I went back-to-back films.

I watched two movies.

Starting point is 03:03:11

And you don't have like a ring around here.

It's not.

It's temporary.

It goes away after about an hour.

Yes, my wife did say something about it.

But.

What was she?

doing?

Starting point is 03:03:20

When she was she there?

It was a rare situation where she was out of the house with the kids, and so I just

had free time.

I never had to.

But truly, truly around family, like, you can't use it because it's so antisocial,

even with the eye, it just doesn't work.

So, like, I actually finished watching Terminator 2 just on my phone because it was

less antisocial than putting this VR headset back on once the family came up.

Starting point is 03:03:42

Anyway, I did successfully watch a full movie in VR, let it be known.

I did.

but I can't tell,

and I think I already know the answer now that you're laughing at me,

but am I like one year early?

Am I 10 years early to watching movies in VR?

Or am I just weird and it's never going to happen?

You're going to watch movies and glasses for sure, right?

Starting point is 03:04:02

And I think like what, you know, it's so funny.

A couple of my buddies, you know, are big into finance stuff like that.

So like if we travel together, you know, they'll bring their monitor to like, oh, yeah, yeah, come on.

You can't get stuff done without your...

You just got the new Dell one.

Oh, wait, we did it? That's the actual dollar one.

It's like six feet long.

That's amazing.

Starting point is 03:04:20

You got to have your setup.

Yeah, yeah.

And so they travel with like a big monitor or, you know, even two monitors.

So I think like a lot of the early stuff you're going to see with glasses are people who just want the full setup.

But like do not want to ship, you know, a monitor to wherever they're going.

So I think like if you're, you know, if you're traveling or you're, you know, on a plane or something, you want to really get work done.

It's so hard to do that on a laptop.

So I think you're right on time, actually.

Starting point is 03:04:46

Right on time.

Or a pioneer.

Next time you come on, we'll ask, have you watched a full movie in any VR product?

And we'll see.

We'll see if I'm early or just weird.

What do you think about timelines for watching movies in glasses?

That's a this year thing.

Yeah.

Starting point is 03:05:01

And then what about glasses?

Is it that you still have some element of the real world?

It's not as anti, you know, you're not getting the like, you know.

Yeah, it's not this huge, heavy closed headset with a screen, you know, right in front of your eyeball.

So I mean, sorry, it seems like you love it.

I was, so the trick is that I was laying perfectly flat.

In a fully bright room.

Yeah, oh, yeah, this is the other thing.

Starting point is 03:05:26

This is the other thing.

It needs tracking, so you have to leave the lights on.

I'm not kidding.

I'm not kidding.

Seriously, so you can't turn off the lights.

And so if I get home and my wife wants to go to bed and turn off the lights, I'm like,

okay, it doesn't work.

No way.

Starting point is 03:05:39

Because it loses the tracking.

No way.

But if you rest it right on your head, just perfectly.

And then also the VR headset, it wants to be world-locked.

So initially, the screen is down here and you have to look like this,

and then you have to re-center it up here,

and then it appears above you in beautiful 4K, and it's amazing.

And you sit there and you watch the Matrix from start to finish,

Starting point is 03:06:01

and it's actually a great experience.

But it is weird and niche, and I don't know if it'll ever happen.

But I think the idea of being able to watch something on a giant display in a lightweight

pair of glasses is compelling.

Oh, yeah, if it's lightweight.

But, like, truly, you actually can't have a VR headset on your face for more than 10 minutes.

It's bad.

I love that a super bright.

Starting point is 03:06:20

It has to be bright.

Like, the ISO on these cameras is so low that even if I just have my lamp on, it's, like, all fuzzy and noisy, you know?

It's terrible.

Get a warehouse and get a bunch of, like, yoga mats and they have the Vision Pros, and it's a VR movie theater.

You go and you just lay in the bright area.

Super bright.

It really is, like, the most dystopian, antisocial thing.

possibly do. But The Matrix is a great movie, so it was worth it.

Starting point is 03:06:45

I sacrificed it. For the board.

And you broke the record.

I did. I did. Call Guinness right now.

When you all aren't live, you just move the table, put some mats down, and then you've got

the future. Yeah, yeah, it's perfect.

It's perfectly lit. Anyway, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Great to catch up. Thanks for having. Good to see it. Yeah. Congrats to the whole team.
